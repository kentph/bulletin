"@wdio/appium-service@6.6.0","https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio","MIT","","WebdriverIO Appium Service ==========================  Handling the Appium server is out of scope of the actual WebdriverIO project. This service helps you to run the Appium server seamlessly when running tests with the [WDIO testrunner](https://webdriver.io/guide/testrunner/gettingstarted.html). It starts the [Appium Server](http://appium.io/docs/en/about-appium/getting-started/index.html#starting-appium) in a child process.  ## Installation  The easiest way is to keep `@wdio/appium-service` as a devDependency in your `package.json`.  ```json {     'devDependencies': {         '@wdio/appium-service': '^6.1.16'     } } ```  You can simple do it by:  ```bash npm install @wdio/appium-service --save-dev ```  Instructions on how to install `WebdriverIO` can be found [here.](https://webdriver.io/docs/gettingstarted.html)  ## Configuration  In order to use the service you need to add `appium` to your service array:  ```js // wdio.conf.js export.config = {     // ...     port: 4723, // default appium port     services: ['appium'],     // ... }; ```  ## Options  The following options can be added to the wdio.conf.js file. To define options for the service you need to add the service to the `services` list in the following way:  ```js // wdio.conf.js export.config = {     // ...     port: 4723, // default appium port     services: [         ['appium', {             // Appium service options here             // ...         }]     ],     // ... }; ```  ### logPath Path where all logs from the Appium server should be stored.  Type: `String`  Example: ```js export.config = {     // ...     services: [         ['appium', {             logPath : './'         }]     ],     // ... } ```  ### command To use your own installation of Appium, e.g. globally installed, specify the command which should be started.  Type: `String`  Example: ```js export.config = {     // ...     services: [         ['appium', {             command : 'appium'         }]     ],     // ... } ```  ### args Map of arguments for the Appium server, passed directly to `appium`.  See [the documentation](http://appium.io/docs/en/writing-running-appium/server-args/index.html) for possible arguments. The arguments should be supplied in lower camel case, so `--pre-launch true` becomes `preLaunch: true` or passed as an array.  Type: `Object` or `Array`  Default: `{}`  Example: ```js export.config = {     // ...     services: [         ['appium', {             args: {                 // ...                 debugLogSpacing: true,                 platformName: 'iOS',                 // ...             }             // or             // args: ['-p', '4722', '--relaxed-security', '--log-level', 'info:info']         }]     ],     // ... } ```  ----  For more information on WebdriverIO see the [homepage](https://webdriver.io)."

See the list of supported Mocha options [here](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/wiki/Using-mocha-programmatically#set-options).  ----  ## `mochaOpts.require (string|string[])`  The `require` option is useful when you want to add or extend some basic functionality. <br /> For example, let's try to create an anonymous `describe`:  **wdio.conf.js**  ```js {   suites: {     login: ['tests/login/*.js']   },    mochaOpts: {     require: './hooks/mocha.js'   } } ```  **./hooks/mocha.js**  ```js import path from 'path';  let { context, file, mocha, options } = module.parent.context; let { describe } = context;  context.describe = function (name, callback) { 	if (callback) { 		return describe(...arguments); 	} else { 		callback = name; 		name = path.basename(file, '.js');  		return describe(name, callback); 	} } ```  **./tests/TEST-XXX.js**  ```js describe(() => { 	it('Login form', function () => { 		this.skip(); 	}); }); ```  **Output**  ``` TEST-XXX    ✓ Login form ```  ## `mochaOpts.compilers (string[])`  Use the given module(s) to compile files. Compilers will be included before requires.  CoffeeScript and similar transpilers may be used by mapping the file extensions and the module name.  ```js {   mochaOpts: {     compilers: ['coffee:foo', './bar.js']   } } ```  For more information on WebdriverIO see the [homepage](https://webdriver.io)."

"@wdio/reporter@6.6.0","https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio","MIT","","WebdriverIO Reporter ====================  > A WebdriverIO utility to help reporting all events  The `@wdio/reporter` package can be used to create own custom reporter and publish them to NPM. They have to follow a specific convention as described below in order to work properly. First you need to add `@wdio/reporter` as dependency of your custom reporter:  ```sh npm install @wdio/reporter ```  or  ```sh yarn add @wdio/reporter ```  Then you need to extend your reporter with the main `@wdio/reporter` class:  ```js import Reporter from '@wdio/reporter'  export default MyCustomReporter extends Reporter {     constructor () {         super()         // your custom logic if necessary         // ...     }      onRunnerStart () {         // ...     }      onSuiteStart (suite) {         // ...     }      // ... } ```  The `Reporter` parent class calls your event functions if provided when an event was triggered and provides information on that event in a consistent format. You can always register your own listener to receive the raw data that was provided by the framework, e.g. instead of using the `onSuiteStart` method you can do:  ```js this.on('suite:start', (raw) => {     // ... }) ```  in your constructor function.  ## Configuration  User can pass in custom configurations for each reporter. Per default WebdriverIO populates the `outputDir` and `logLevel` option to the reporter, they can get overwritten too. For example, if the user has provided the following reporter options:  ```js // wdio.conf.js exports.config = {     // ...     reporters: ['dot', ['my-reporter', {         outputDir: '/some/path',         foo: 'bar'     }]]     // ... } ```  your options in your reporter class are as follows:  ```js export default class MyReporter extends Reporter {     constructor () {         super()         console.log(this.options)         /**          * outputs:          * {          *   outputDir: '/some/path',          *   logLevel: 'trace',          *   foo: 'bar'          * }          */     } } ```  You can access all options via `this.options`. You can push logs to stdout or a log file depending of whether the `stdout` option is true or false. Please use the internal method `write` that is provided by the `Reporter` parent class in order to push out logs, e.g.  ```js class MyReporter extends Reporter {     constructor (options) {         /**          * make dot reporter to write to output stream by default          */         options = Object.assign(options, { stdout: true })         super(options)     }      // ...     onTestPass (test) {         this.write(`test '${test.title}' passed`)     }     // ... } ```  This will result the following output:  ``` 'MyReporter' Reporter: test 'some test' passed test 'some other test' passed  'spec' Reporter: ... ```  If `stdout` is set to `false` WebdriverIO will automatically write to a filestream at a location where other logs are stored as well.  ## Synchronization  If your reporter needs to do some async computation after the test (e.g. upload logs to a server) you can overwrite the `isSynchronised` getter method to manage this. By default this property always returns true as most of the reporters don't require to do any async work. However in case you need to handle this overwrite the getter method with an custom implementation (e.g. [wdio-sumologic-reporter](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/tree/master/packages/wdio-sumologic-reporter)).  ```js class MyReporter extends Reporter {     constructor (options) {         // ...     }      get isSynchronised (test) {         return this.unsyncedMessages.length === 0     }      // ... } ```  The wdio testrunner will wait to kill the runner process until every reporter has the `isSynchronised` property set to `true`.  ## Events  During a test run in WebdriverIO several events are thrown and can be captured by your event functions. The following events are propagated:  ### Test Events  These events are containing data about the test regardless of the framework it is running in.  ##### onSuiteStart  ```js SuiteStats {   type:

"@wdio/sync@6.6.0","https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio","MIT","","WebdriverIO Sync ================  > A WebdriverIO plugin. Helper module to run WebdriverIO commands synchronously  A WebdriverIO plugin. Helper module to run WebdriverIO commands synchronously. It overwrites global functions depending on the test framework (e.g. for Mocha describe and it) and uses Fibers to make commands of WebdriverIO using the wdio testrunner synchronous. This package is consumed by all wdio framework adapters.  ## Usage  ### Using WDIO Testrunner  If you are using the WDIO testrunner all you need to make all your specs run synchronous is to have `@wdio/sync` installed in your project. The testrunner automatically will detect it and transform the commands to make a test like this:  ```js describe('webdriver.io page', () => {     it('should have the right title', async () => {         await browser.url('https://webdriver.io')         await expect(browser)             .toHaveTitle('WebdriverIO · Next-gen browser and mobile automation test framework for Node.js')     }) }) ```  easier to read and write like this:  ```js describe('webdriver.io page', () => {     it('should have the right title', () => {         browser.url('https://webdriver.io')         expect(browser).toHaveTitle('WebdriverIO · Next-gen browser and mobile automation test framework for Node.js')     }) }) ```  ### Using WebdriverIO as standalone package  Given you have a simple standalone WebdriverIO script like this:  ```js // standalone.js const { remote } = require('webdriverio') const sync = require('@wdio/sync').default  ;(() => {     const browser = await remote({         outputDir: __dirname,         capabilities: {             browserName: 'chrome'         }     })      await browser.url('https://webdriver.io')     console.log(await browser.getTitle())     await browser.deleteSession() })().catch(console.error) ```  With this package you can make WebdriverIO commands synchronous by using the `sync` wrapper:  ```js // standalone.js const { remote } = require('webdriverio') const sync = require('@wdio/sync').default  remote({     runner: 'local',     outputDir: __dirname,     capabilities: {         browserName: 'chrome'     } }).then((browser) => sync(() => {     /**      * sync code from here on      */     browser.url('https://webdriver.io')     console.log(browser.getTitle())     browser.deleteSession() })) ```  ## Switching Between Sync And Async  While using `@wdio/sync` you can still switch between both by using the `browser.call()` command. It allows you to run async code and return the result into a synchronous environment. For example:  ```js describe('webdriver.io page', () => {     it('should have the right title', () => {         /**          * synchronous execution here          */         browser.url('https://webdriver.io')          const result = browser.call(async () => {             /**              * asynchronous execution here              */             await browser.url('https://google.com')             return Promise.all([                 browser.getTitle(),                 browser.getUrl()             ])         })          /**          * synchronous execution here          */         console.log(result) // returns: ['Google', 'https://www.google.com/']     }) }) ```"

That is, you pass it an async callback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the given callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.  #### Some subclasses:  Here's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`. Send a pull request to list yours!   * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints  * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints  * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS  * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS (v4a) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS   Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ``` bash $ npm install agent-base ```   Example -------  Here's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server for every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):  ```js var net = require('net'); var tls = require('tls'); var url = require('url'); var http = require('http'); var agent = require('agent-base');  var endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/'; var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);  // This is the important part! parsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {   var socket;   // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module   if (opts.secureEndpoint) {     socket = tls.connect(opts);   } else {     socket = net.connect(opts);   }   return socket; });  // Everything else works just like normal... http.get(parsed, function (res) {   console.log(''response' event!', res.headers);   res.pipe(process.stdout); }); ```  Returning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:  ```js agent(async function (req, opts) {   await sleep(1000);   // etc… }); ```  Return another `http.Agent` instance to 'pass through' the responsibility for that HTTP request to that agent:  ```js agent(function (req, opts) {   return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent; }); ```   API ---  ## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]  Creates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback` for every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function is responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be used as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.  The `options` object accepts the following properties:    * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).  The callback function should have the following signature:  ### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined  The ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and and the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed to the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted to be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however else you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to the callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will continue to proceed.  If the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the `secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.

"appium-safari-driver@2.2.0","https://github.com/appium/appium-safari-driver","Apache-2.0","","appium-safari-driver ====  This is Appium driver for automating Safari on [Mac OS X](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/testing_with_webdriver_in_safari?language=objc) and iOS [since version 13](https://webkit.org/blog/9395/webdriver-is-coming-to-safari-in-ios-13/). The driver only supports Safari automation using [W3C WebDriver protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/). Under the hood this driver is a wrapper/proxy over Apple's `safaridriver` binary. Check the output of `man safaridriver` command to get more details on the supported features and possible pitfalls.  ## Usage  It is mandatory to run the `safaridriver --enable` command from the Mac OS terminal and provide your administrator password before any automated session will be executed. In order to automate Safari on real devices it is also necessary to enable Remote Automation switch in `Settings → Safari → Advanced → Remote Automation` for these particular devices.  Then you need to decide where the automated test is going to be executed. Safari driver supports the following target platforms:  - Mac OS (High Sierra or newer)  - iOS Simulator (iOS version 13 or newer)  - iOS Real Device (iOS version 13 or newer)  Safari driver allows to define multiple criterions for platform selection and also to fine-tune your automation session properties. This could be done via the following session capabilities:  Capability Name | Description --- | --- platformName | safaridriver binary can only create WebDriver sessions for desktop or mobile Safari and can only run on Mac OS. Value of platformName could equal to 'Mac' or 'iOS' in order to start Safari driver session for the corresponding platform. Values of platformName are compared case-insensitively. automationName | Value of automationName must equal to 'Safari' in order to start Safari driver session. Values of automationName are compared case-insensitively. browserName | safaridriver can only create WebDriver sessions for Safari. Any value passed to this capability will be changed to 'Safari'. browserVersion | safaridriver will only create a session using hosts whose Safari version matches the value of browserVersion. Browser version numbers are prefix-matched. For example, if the value of browserVersion is '12', this will allow hosts with a Safari version of '12.0.1' or '12.1'. safari:platformVersion | safaridriver will only create a session using hosts whose OS version matches the value of safari:platformVersion. OS version numbers are prefix-matched. For example, if the value of safari:platformVersion is '12',  this will allow hosts with an OS version of '12.0' or '12.1' but not '10.12'. safari:platformBuildVersion | safaridriver will only create a session using hosts whose OS build version matches the value of safari:platformBuildVersion. example of a macOS build version is '18E193'. On macOS, the OS build version can be determined by running the sw_vers(1) utility. safari:useSimulator | If the value of safari:useSimulator is true, safaridriver will only use iOS Simulator hosts. If the value of safari:useSimulator is false, safaridriver will not use iOS Simulator hosts. NOTE: An Xcode installation is required in order to run WebDriver tests on iOS Simulator hosts. safari:deviceType | If the value of safari:deviceType is 'iPhone', safaridriver will only create a session using an iPhone device or iPhone simulator. If the value of safari:deviceType is 'iPad', safaridriver will only create a session using an iPad device or iPad simulator. Values of safari:deviceType are compared case-insensitively. safari:deviceName | safaridriver will only create a session using hosts whose device name matches the value of safari:deviceName. Device names are compared case-insensitively. NOTE: Device names for connected devices are shown in iTunes. If Xcode is installed, device names for connected devices are available via the output of instruments(1) and in the Devices and Simulators window (accessed in Xcode via 'Window > Devices and Simulators'). safari:deviceUDID | safaridriver will only create a session using hosts whose device UDID matches the value of safari:deviceUDID. Device UDIDs are compared case-insensitively. NOTE: If Xcode is installed, UDIDs for connected devices are available via the output of instruments(1) and in the Devices and Simulators window (accessed in Xcode via 'Window > Devices and Simulators'). safari:automaticInspection | This capability instructs Safari to preload the Web Inspector and JavaScript debugger in the background prior to returning a newly-created window. To pause the test's execution in JavaScript and bring up Web Inspector's Debugger tab, you can simply evaluate a debugger; statement in the test page. safari:automaticProfiling | This capability instructs Safari to preload the Web Inspector and start a Timeline recording in the background prior to returning a newly-created window. To view the recording, open the Web Inspector through Safari's Develop menu. webkit:WebRTC | This capability allows a test to temporarily change Safari's policies for WebRTC and Media Capture. The value of the webkit:WebRTC capability is a dictionary with the following sub-keys, all of which are optional: `DisableInsecureMediaCapture` - Normally, Safari refuses to allow media capture over insecure connections. This restriction is relaxed by default for WebDriver sessions for testing purposes (for example, a test web server not configured for HTTPS).  When this capability is specified, Safari will revert to the normal behavior of preventing media capture over insecure connections. `DisableICECandidateFiltering` - To protect a user's privacy, Safari normally filters out WebRTC ICE candidates that correspond to internal network addresses when capture devices are not in use. This capability suppresses ICE candidate filtering so that both internal and external network addresses are always sent as ICE candidates.   ## Example  ```python # Python3 + PyTest import pytest import time  from appium import webdriver from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By   def generate_caps():     common_caps = {         # It does not really matter what to put there, although setting 'Safari' might cause a failure         # depending on the particular client library         'browserName': 'AppiumSafari',         # automationName capability presence is mandatory for this Safari Driver to be selected         'automationName': 'Safari',     }     real_device_caps = {         **common_caps,         'platformName': 'iOS',         # This capability is optional         'safari:deviceType': 'iPhone',         # Do not forget to verify that Remote Automation is enabled for this device         'safari:deviceUDID': '<MyDeviceUDID>',         'safari:useSimulator': False,     }     simulator_caps = {         **common_caps,         'platformName': 'iOS',         'safari:platformVersion': '14.1',         'safari:deviceName': 'iPad Air 2',         'safari:useSimulator': True,     }     desktop_browser_caps = {         **common_caps,         'platformName': 'Mac',     }     return [real_device_caps, simulator_caps, desktop_browser_caps]   @pytest.fixture(params=generate_caps()) def driver(request):     drv = webdriver.Remote('http://localhost:4723/wd/hub', request.param)     yield drv     drv.quit()   class TimeoutError(Exception):     pass   def wait_until_truthy(func, timeout_sec=5.0, interval_sec=0.5):     started = time.time()     original_error = None     while time.time() - started < timeout_sec:         original_error = None         try:             result = func()             if result:                 return result         except Exception as e:             original_error = e         time.sleep(interval_sec)     if original_error is None:         raise TimeoutError(f'Condition unmet after {timeout_sec}s timeout')     raise original_error   def test_feature_status_page_search(driver):     driver.get('https://webkit.org/status/')      # Enter 'CSS' into the search box.     # Ensures that at least one result appears in search     # !!!

"argparse@2.0.1","https://github.com/nodeca/argparse","Python-2.0","Copyright (c) 1991 - 1995, Stichting Mathematisch Centrum Amsterdam,. The Netherlands.  All rights reserved.","A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE ==========================  Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.  In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us) in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software.  In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property. Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.  All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.      Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-                     from                                compatible? (1)      0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes     1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes     1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no     2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no     1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)     2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no     2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes     2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes     2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes     2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes     2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes  Footnotes:  (1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under     the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute     a modified version without making your changes open source.  The     GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with     other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.  (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,     because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to     CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1     is 'not incompatible' with the GPL.  Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's direction to make these releases possible.   B.

"assert-plus@1.0.0","https://github.com/mcavage/node-assert-plus","MIT","","# assert-plus  This library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two things: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable NODE\_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like `assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks like this:  ```javascript     var assert = require('assert-plus');      function fooAccount(options, callback) {         assert.object(options, 'options');         assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');         assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');         assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');         assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');         assert.func(callback, 'callback');          // Do stuff         callback(null, {});     } ```  # API  All methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to take an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError` will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:      AssertionError: foo (string) is required     at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)     at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)     at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)     at Object..js (module.js:464:10)     at Module.load (module.js:353:31)     at Function._load (module.js:311:12)     at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)     at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)  from:  ```javascript     function test(foo) {         assert.string(foo, 'foo');     } ```  There you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:  ```javascript     function test(foo) {         assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');     } ```  You can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):  ```javascript     assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo'); ```  Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the environment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have lots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in production.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are also disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from the `assert` module avoids this behavior.  The complete list of APIs is:  * assert.array * assert.bool * assert.buffer * assert.func * assert.number * assert.finite * assert.object * assert.string * assert.stream * assert.date * assert.regexp * assert.uuid * assert.arrayOfArray * assert.arrayOfBool * assert.arrayOfBuffer * assert.arrayOfFunc * assert.arrayOfNumber * assert.arrayOfFinite * assert.arrayOfObject * assert.arrayOfString * assert.arrayOfStream * assert.arrayOfDate * assert.arrayOfRegexp * assert.arrayOfUuid * assert.optionalArray * assert.optionalBool * assert.optionalBuffer * assert.optionalFunc * assert.optionalNumber * assert.optionalFinite * assert.optionalObject * assert.optionalString * assert.optionalStream * assert.optionalDate * assert.optionalRegexp * assert.optionalUuid * assert.optionalArrayOfArray * assert.optionalArrayOfBool * assert.optionalArrayOfBuffer * assert.optionalArrayOfFunc * assert.optionalArrayOfNumber * assert.optionalArrayOfFinite * assert.optionalArrayOfObject * assert.optionalArrayOfString * assert.optionalArrayOfStream * assert.optionalArrayOfDate * assert.optionalArrayOfRegexp * assert.optionalArrayOfUuid * assert.AssertionError * assert.fail * assert.ok * assert.equal * assert.notEqual * assert.deepEqual * assert.notDeepEqual * assert.strictEqual * assert.notStrictEqual * assert.throws * assert.doesNotThrow * assert.ifError  # Installation      npm install assert-plus  ## License  The MIT License (MIT) Copyright (c) 2012 Mark Cavage  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

"base64-stream@1.0.0","https://github.com/mazira/base64-stream","MIT","","# Introduction  While Node.js has built-in support for Base64 data, it does not come with the ability to encode / decode data in a stream.  This library contains a streaming Base64 encoder and a streaming Base64 decoder for use with Node.js. These classes are written using the Node.js [stream interfaces](http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html) and are well covered with unit tests.  # Usage  ## Installation  To install base64-stream      npm install base64-stream      ## Examples This example encodes an image and pipes it to stdout.  ```javascript var http = require('http'); var {Base64Encode} = require('base64-stream');  var img = 'http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2433/3973241798_86ddfa642b_o.jpg'; http.get(img, function(res) {     if (res.statusCode === 200)         res.pipe(new Base64Encode()).pipe(process.stdout); }); ```  This example takes in Base64 encoded data on stdin, decodes it, an pipes it to stdout. ```javascript var {Base64Encode} = require('base64-stream'); process.stdin.pipe(new Base64Encode()).pipe(process.stdout); ```  ## options:  `Base64Encode` can take an optional object `{lineLength: number, prefix: string}`   The prefix is useful for prepending for example `data:image/png;base64,` to make a base64 URL.   This example proxies an image url, and send the base64 string in response.  ``` app.get('/i/*', function(req, res){ // using express for example 	fetch(req.params[0]) // using node-fetch 	.then(r=>r.body.pipe(new Base64Encode({prefix:`data:${r.headers.get('content-type')};base64,`})).pipe(res)) 	.catch(console.error); }); ```  # Requirements  This module currently requires Node 6.0.0 or higher.  # Testing  To run the unit tests      npm test  # License MIT"

"debounce@1.2.0","https://github.com/component/debounce","MIT","","# debounce    Useful for implementing behavior that should only happen after a repeated   action has completed.  ## Installation      $ component install component/debounce    Or in node:      $ npm install debounce  ## Example  ```js var debounce = require('debounce'); window.onresize = debounce(resize, 200);  function resize(e) {   console.log('height', window.innerHeight);   console.log('width', window.innerWidth); } ```  To later clear the timer and cancel currently scheduled executions: ``` window.onresize.clear(); ```  To execute any pending invocations and reset the timer: ``` window.onresize.flush(); ```  Alternately, if using newer syntax:  ```js import { debounce } from 'debounce'; ```  ## API  ### debounce(fn, wait, [ immediate || false ])    Creates and returns a new debounced version of the passed function that   will postpone its execution until after wait milliseconds have elapsed   since the last time it was invoked.    Pass `true` for the `immediate` parameter to cause debounce to trigger   the function on the leading edge instead of the trailing edge of the wait   interval. Useful in circumstances like preventing accidental double-clicks   on a 'submit' button from firing a second time.    The debounced function returned has a property 'clear' that is a    function that will clear any scheduled future executions of your function.    The debounced function returned has a property 'flush' that is a    function that will immediately execute the function if and only if execution is scheduled,   and reset the execution timer for subsequent invocations of the debounced   function.  ## License    MIT    Original implementation is from [`underscore.js`](http://underscorejs.org/)   which also has an MIT license."

"easy-table@1.1.1","git+https://eldargab@github.com/eldargab/easy-table","MIT","Copyright (c) 2015 Eldar Gabdullin <eldargab@gmail.com>","# Easy table  Nice utility for rendering text tables with javascript.  ## Usage  ```javascript var Table = require('easy-table')  var data = [   { id: 123123, desc: 'Something awesome', price: 1000.00 },   { id: 245452, desc: 'Very interesting book', price: 11.45},   { id: 232323, desc: 'Yet another product', price: 555.55 } ]  var t = new Table  data.forEach(function(product) {   t.cell('Product Id', product.id)   t.cell('Description', product.desc)   t.cell('Price, USD', product.price, Table.number(2))   t.newRow() })  console.log(t.toString()) ```  The script above will render:  ``` Product Id  Description            Price, USD ----------  ---------------------  ---------- 123123      Something awesome         1000.00 245452      Very interesting book       11.45 232323      Yet another product        555.55 ```  `t.printTransposed()` returns  ``` Product Id  : 245452                : 232323              : 123123 Description : Very interesting book : Yet another product : Something awesome Price, USD  : 11.45                 : 555.55              : 1000.00 ```  `t.print()` shows just rows you pushed and nothing more  ``` 123123  Something awesome      1000.00 245452  Very interesting book    11.45 232323  Yet another product     555.55 ```  ### How it works  The full signature of `.cell()` is:  ```javascript t.cell(column, value, printer) ```  Rendering occures in two phases. At the first phase `printer` is called to get the minimal width required to fit the cell content. At the second phase `printer` is called again with additional `width` parameter to get actual string to render.  For example, here is how currency printer might be defined  ``` javascript function currency(val, width) {   var str = val.toFixed(2)   return width ? Table.padLeft(str, width) : str } ```  ### Table.print()  When you already have an array, explicit table instantiation and iteration becomes an overhead. For such cases it is convenient to use `Table.print()`.  ``` javascript console.log(Table.print(data)) ```  ``` id      desc                   price ------  ---------------------  ------ 123123  Something awesome      1000 245452  Very interesting book  11.45 232323  Yet another product    555.55 ```  It is possible to pass some options  ``` javascript Table.print(data, {   desc: {name: 'description'}   price: {printer: Table.number(2)} }) ```  ``` id      description            price ------  ---------------------  ------- 123123  Something awesome      1000.00 245452  Very interesting book    11.45 232323  Yet another product     555.55 ```  or have a full control over rendering  ``` javascript Table.print(data, function(item, cell) {   cell('Product id', item.id)   cell('Price, USD', item.price) }, function(table) {   return table.print() }) ```  `Table.print()` also accepts objects  ``` javascript Table.print(data[0]) ```  ``` id    : 123123 desc  : Something awesome price : 1000 ```  ### Sorting  You can sort a table by calling `.sort()`, and optionally passing in a list of column names to sort on (by default uses all columns), or a custom comparator function. It is also possible to specify the sort order. For example:  ``` javascript t.sort(['Price, USD|des']) // will sort in descending order t.sort(['Price, USD|asc']) // will sort in ascending order t.sort(['Price, USD']) // sorts in ascending order by default ```  ### Totaling  Easy table can help to calculate and render totals:  ``` javascript t.total('Price, USD') ```  ``` Product Id  Description            Price, USD ----------  ---------------------  ---------- 245452      Very interesting book       11.45 232323      Yet another product        555.55 123123      Something awesome         1000.00 ----------  ---------------------  ----------                                       1567.00 ```  Here is a more elaborate example  ```javascript t.total('Price, USD', {   printer: Table.aggr.printer('Avg: ', currency),   reduce: Table.aggr.avg,   init: 0 })  // or alternatively  t.total('Price, USD', {   printer: function(val, width) {     return padLeft('Avg: ' + currency(val), width)   },   reduce: function(acc, val, idx, len) {     acc = acc + val     return idx + 1 == len ? acc/len : acc   } }) ```  ``` Product Id  Description            Price, USD ----------  ---------------------  ----------- 245452      Very interesting book        11.45 232323      Yet another product         555.55 123123      Something awesome          1000.00 ----------  ---------------------  -----------                                    Avg: 522.33 ```  ## Installation  via npm  ``` $ npm install easy-table ```  ## License  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2015 Eldar Gabdullin <eldargab@gmail.com>  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7.

"emitter-listener@1.1.2","https://github.com/othiym23/emitter-listener","BSD-2-Clause","","## Add dynamic instrumentation to emitters  `shimmer` does a bunch of the work necessary to wrap other methods in a wrapper you provide:  ```javascript var EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter; var wrapEmitter = require('emitter-listener');  var ee = new EventEmitter();  var id = 0;  wrapEmitter(   ee,   function mark(listener) {     listener.id = id++;   },   function prepare(listener) {     console.log('listener id is %d', listener.id);   } ); ```  ### Mandatory disclaimer  There are times when it's necessary to monkeypatch default behavior in JavaScript and Node. However, changing the behavior of the runtime on the fly is rarely a good idea, and you should be using this module because you need to, not because it seems like fun.  #### wrapEmitter(emitter, mark, prepare)  Wrap an EventEmitter's event listeners. Each listener will be passed to `mark` when it is registered with `.addListener()` or `.on()`, and then each listener is passed to `prepare` to be wrapped before it's called by the `.emit()` call. `wrapListener` deals with the single listener vs array of listeners logic, and also ensures that edge cases like `.removeListener()` being called from within an `.emit()` for the same event type is handled properly.  The wrapped EE can be restored to its pristine state by using emitter.__unwrap(), but this should only be used if you *really* know what you're doing."

If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

(twitter: [@Constellation](https://twitter.com/Constellation)) and other contributors.","### Esrecurse [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse)  Esrecurse ([esrecurse](https://github.com/estools/esrecurse)) is [ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm) recursive traversing functionality.  ### Example Usage  The following code will output all variables declared at the root of a file.  ```javascript esrecurse.visit(ast, {     XXXStatement: function (node) {         this.visit(node.left);         // do something...         this.visit(node.right);     } }); ```  We can use `Visitor` instance.  ```javascript var visitor = new esrecurse.Visitor({     XXXStatement: function (node) {         this.visit(node.left);         // do something...         this.visit(node.right);     } });  visitor.visit(ast); ```  We can inherit `Visitor` instance easily.  ```javascript class Derived extends esrecurse.Visitor {     constructor()     {         super(null);     }      XXXStatement(node) {     } } ```  ```javascript function DerivedVisitor() {     esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */); } util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor); DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {     this.visit(node.left);     // do something...     this.visit(node.right); }; ```  And you can invoke default visiting operation inside custom visit operation.  ```javascript function DerivedVisitor() {     esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */); } util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor); DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {     // do something...     this.visitChildren(node); }; ```  The `childVisitorKeys` option does customize the behaviour of `this.visitChildren(node)`. We can use user-defined node types.  ```javascript // This tree contains a user-defined `TestExpression` node. var tree = {     type: 'TestExpression',      // This 'argument' is the property containing the other **node**.     argument: {         type: 'Literal',         value: 20     },      // This 'extended' is the property not containing the other **node**.     extended: true }; esrecurse.visit(     ast,     {         Literal: function (node) {             // do something...         }     },     {         // Extending the existing traversing rules.         childVisitorKeys: {             // TargetNodeName: [ 'keys', 'containing', 'the', 'other', '**node**' ]             TestExpression: ['argument']         }     } ); ```  We can use the `fallback` option as well. If the `fallback` option is `'iteration'`, `esrecurse` would visit all enumerable properties of unknown nodes. Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).  ```javascript esrecurse.visit(     ast,     {         Literal: function (node) {             // do something...         }     },     {         fallback: 'iteration'     } ); ```  If the `fallback` option is a function, `esrecurse` calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes. Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).  ```javascript esrecurse.visit(     ast,     {         Literal: function (node) {             // do something...         }     },     {         fallback: function (node) {             return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key) {                 return key !== 'argument'             });         }     } ); ```  ### License  Copyright (C) 2014 [Yusuke Suzuki](https://github.com/Constellation)  (twitter: [@Constellation](https://twitter.com/Constellation)) and other contributors.

"filelist@1.0.1","https://github.com/mde/filelist","Apache-2.0","","## FileList  A FileList is a lazy-evaluated list of files. When given a list of glob patterns for possible files to be included in the file list, instead of searching the file structures to find the files, a FileList holds the pattern for latter use.  This allows you to define a FileList to match any number of files, but only search out the actual files when then FileList itself is actually used. The key is that the first time an element of the FileList/Array is requested, the pending patterns are resolved into a real list of file names.  ### Usage  Add files to the list with the `include` method. You can add glob patterns, individual files, or RegExp objects. When the Array methods are invoked on the FileList, these items are resolved to an actual list of files.  ```javascript var fl = new FileList(); fl.include('test/*.js'); fl.exclude('test/helpers.js'); ```  Use the `exclude` method to override inclusions. You can use this when your inclusions are too broad.  ### Array methods  FileList has lazy-evaluated versions of most of the array methods, including the following:  * join * pop * push * concat * reverse * shift * unshift * slice * splice * sort * filter * forEach * some * every * map * indexOf * lastIndexOf * reduce * reduceRight  When you call one of these methods, the items in the FileList will be resolved to the full list of files, and the method will be invoked on that result.  ### Special `length` method  `length`: FileList includes a length *method* (instead of a property) which returns the number of actual files in the list once it's been resolved.  ### FileList-specific methods  `include`: Add a filename/glob/regex to the list  `exclude`: Override inclusions by excluding a filename/glob/regex  `resolve`: Resolve the items in the FileList to the full list of files. This method is invoked automatically when one of the array methods is called.  `toArray`: Immediately resolves the list of items, and returns an actual array of filepaths.  `clearInclusions`: Clears any pending items -- must be used before resolving the list.  `clearExclusions`: Clears the list of exclusions rules."
"filewatcher@3.0.1","https://github.com/fgnass/filewatcher","MIT","Copyright (c) 2013-2016 Felix Gnass","# filewatcher  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fgnass/filewatcher.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fgnass/filewatcher)  Simple wrapper around `fs.watch` that works around the [various issues](https://github.com/joyent/node/search?q=fs.watch&type=Issues) you have to deal with when using the Node API directly.  More precisely filewatcher … * always reports file names (for all events on all OSes) * works well with editors that perform atomic writes (save & rename) like Sublime Text or vim * doesn't fire twice when files are saved * falls back to `fs.watchFile` when running out of file handles * has no native dependencies * uses Node's async APIs under the hood  This module is used by [node-dev](https://npmjs.org/package/node-dev) and [instant](https://npmjs.org/package/instant).  ### Usage  ```js var filewatcher = require('filewatcher');  var watcher = filewatcher();  // watch a file watcher.add(__filename);  // ... or a directory watcher.add(__dirname);  watcher.on('change', function(file, stat) {   console.log('File modified: %s', file);   if (!stat) console.log('deleted'); }); ```  To stop watching, you can remove either a single file or all watched files at once: ```js watcher.remove(file) watcher.removeAll() ```  #### Notify users when falling back to polling  When the process runs out of file handles, _filewatcher_ closes all watchers and transparently switches to `fs.watchFile` polling. You can notify your users by listening to the `fallback` event:  ```js watcher.on('fallback', function(limit) {   console.log('Ran out of file handles after watching %s files.', limit);   console.log('Falling back to polling which uses more CPU.');   console.log('Run ulimit -n 10000 to increase the limit for open files.'); }); ```  ### Options  You can pass options to `filewatcher()` in order to tweak its internal settings. These are the defaults:  ```js // the default options var opts = {   forcePolling: false,  // try event-based watching first   debounce: 10,         // debounce events in non-polling mode by 10ms   interval: 1000,       // if we need to poll, do it every 1000ms   persistent: true      // don't end the process while files are watched };  var watcher = filewatcher(opts) ```  ### The MIT License (MIT)  Copyright (c) 2013-2016 Felix Gnass  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Copyright (c) 2016 Joshua Boy Nicolai Appelman <joshua@jbna.nl>","# Growl for nodejs [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tj/node-growl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tj/node-growl)  Growl support for Nodejs. This is essentially a port of my [Ruby Growl Library](http://github.com/visionmedia/growl). Ubuntu/Linux support added thanks to [@niftylettuce](http://github.com/niftylettuce).  ## Installation  ### Install  ### Mac OS X (Darwin):    Install [growlnotify(1)](http://growl.info/extras.php#growlnotify). On OS X 10.8, Notification Center is supported using [terminal-notifier](https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier). To install:      $ sudo gem install terminal-notifier    Install [npm](http://npmjs.org/) and run:      $ npm install growl  ### Ubuntu (Linux):    Install `notify-send` through the [libnotify-bin](http://packages.ubuntu.com/libnotify-bin) package:      $ sudo apt-get install libnotify-bin    Install [npm](http://npmjs.org/) and run:      $ npm install growl  ### Windows:    Download and install [Growl for Windows](http://www.growlforwindows.com/gfw/default.aspx)    Download [growlnotify](http://www.growlforwindows.com/gfw/help/growlnotify.aspx) - **IMPORTANT :** Unpack growlnotify to a folder that is present in your path!    Install [npm](http://npmjs.org/) and run:      $ npm install growl  ## Examples  Callback functions are optional  ```javascript var growl = require('growl') growl('You have mail!') growl('5 new messages', { sticky: true }) growl('5 new emails', { title: 'Email Client', image: 'Safari', sticky: true }) growl('Message with title', { title: 'Title'}) growl('Set priority', { priority: 2 }) growl('Show Safari icon', { image: 'Safari' }) growl('Show icon', { image: 'path/to/icon.icns' }) growl('Show image', { image: 'path/to/my.image.png' }) growl('Show png filesystem icon', { image: 'png' }) growl('Show pdf filesystem icon', { image: 'article.pdf' }) growl('Show pdf filesystem icon', { image: 'article.pdf' }, function(err){   // ... notified }) ```  ## Options    - title     - notification title   - name     - application name   - priority     - priority for the notification (default is 0)   - sticky     - weither or not the notification should remainin until closed   - image     - Auto-detects the context:       - path to an icon sets --iconpath       - path to an image sets --image       - capitalized word sets --appIcon       - filename uses extname as --icon       - otherwise treated as --icon   - exec     - manually specify a shell command instead       - appends message to end of shell command       - or, replaces `%s` with message       - optionally prepends title (example: `title: message`)       - examples: `{exec: 'tmux display-message'}`, `{exec: 'echo '%s' > messages.log}`  ## License  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2009 TJ Holowaychuk <tj@vision-media.ca> Copyright (c) 2016 Joshua Boy Nicolai Appelman <joshua@jbna.nl>  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

"growly@1.3.0","https://github.com/theabraham/growly","MIT","Copyright (C) 2014 Ibrahim Al-Rajhi <abrahamalrajhi@gmail.com>","# Growly #  Simple zero-dependency Growl notifications using GNTP.  ## Installation ##  Install growly using `npm`:  ``` npm install growly ```  And then require it:  ```javascript var growly = require('growly'); ```  This module uses the Growl Network Transport Protocol (GNTP) which was implemented in Growl since version 1.3, so you **must have an appropriate version of Growl installed** for Growly to work.  ## Example ##  Sending a minimal Growl notification:  ```javascript var growly = require('growly');  growly.notify('This is as easy as it gets', { title: 'Hello, World!' }); ```  More examples can be found in the *example/* directory.  ## Usage ##  The growly module exposes only three methods: `Growly.register()`, `Growly.notify()`, and `Growly.setHost()`.  ### Growly.register(appname, [appicon], [notifications], [callback]) ###  Registers a new application with Growl. Registration is completely optional since it will be performed automatically for you with sensible defaults. Useful if you want your application, with its own icon and types of notifications, to show up in Growl's prefence panel.    - `appname` the name of the application (required.)   - `appicon` url, file path, or Buffer instance for an application icon image.   - `notifications` a list of defined notification types with the following properties:     - `.label` name used to identify the type of notification being used (required.)     - `.dispname` name users will see in Growl's preference panel (defaults to `.label`.)     - `.enabled` whether or not notifications of this type are enabled (defaults to true.)   - `callback` called when the registration completes; if registration fails, the first argument will be an Error object.  An example:  ```javascript growly.register('My Application', 'path/to/icon.png', [     { label: 'success', dispname: 'Success' },     { label: 'warning', dispname: 'Warning', enabled: false } ], function(err) {     console.log(err || 'Registration successful!'); }); ```  ### Growly.notify(text, [opts], [callback]) ###  Sends a Growl notification. If an application wasn't registered beforehand with `growly.register()`, a default application will automatically be registered beforesending the notification.    - `text` the body of the notification.   - `opts` an object with the following properties:     - `.title` title of the notification.     - `.icon` url, file path, or Buffer instance for the notification's icon.     - `.sticky` whether or not to sticky the notification (defaults to false.)     - `.label` type of notification to use (defaults to the first registered notification type.)     - `.priority` the priority of the notification from lowest (-2) to highest (2).     - `.coalescingId` replace/update the matching previous notification. May be ignored.   - `callback` called when the user has closed/clicked the notification. The callback is passed an Error object `err` as the first argument when the notification fails; otherwise, the second argument `action` is a string that'll describe which action has been taken by the user (either 'closed' or 'clicked'.)  An example:  ```javascript /* Assuming an application was registered with a notification type labeled 'warning'. */ growly.notify('Stuffs broken!', { label: 'warning' }, function(err, action) {     console.log('Action:', action); }); ```  ### Growly.setHost(host, port) ###  Set the host and port that Growl (GNTP) requests will be sent to. Using this method is optional since GNTP defaults to using host 'localhost' and port 23053.  ## License ##  Copyright (C) 2014 Ibrahim Al-Rajhi <abrahamalrajhi@gmail.com>  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

"https-proxy-agent@4.0.0","https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent","MIT","Copyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;","https-proxy-agent ================ ### An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS [![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)  This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `https` module.  Specifically, this `Agent` implementation connects to an intermediary 'proxy' server and issues the [CONNECT HTTP method][CONNECT], which tells the proxy to open a direct TCP connection to the destination server.  Since this agent implements the CONNECT HTTP method, it also works with other protocols that use this method when connecting over proxies (i.e. WebSockets). See the 'Examples' section below for more.   Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ``` bash $ npm install https-proxy-agent ```   Examples --------  #### `https` module example  ``` js var url = require('url'); var https = require('https'); var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');  // HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128'; console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);  // HTTPS endpoint for the proxy to connect to var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://graph.facebook.com/tootallnate'; console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint); var options = url.parse(endpoint);  // create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(proxy); options.agent = agent;  https.get(options, function (res) {   console.log(''response' event!', res.headers);   res.pipe(process.stdout); }); ```  #### `ws` WebSocket connection example  ``` js var url = require('url'); var WebSocket = require('ws'); var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');  // HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128'; console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);  // WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org'; var parsed = url.parse(endpoint); console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);  // create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information var options = url.parse(proxy);  var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(options);  // finally, initiate the WebSocket connection var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });  socket.on('open', function () {   console.log(''open' event!');   socket.send('hello world'); });  socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {   console.log(''message' event! %j %j', data, flags);   socket.close(); }); ```  API ---  ### new HttpsProxyAgent(Object options)  The `HttpsProxyAgent` class implements an `http.Agent` subclass that connects to the specified 'HTTP(s) proxy server' in order to proxy HTTPS and/or WebSocket requests. This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].  The `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an 'options' object with more specific properties:    * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.   * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.   * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.   * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.   * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.

"imurmurhash@0.1.4","https://github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js","MIT","","iMurmurHash.js ==============  An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).  This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.  Installation ------------  To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.  ```html <script type='text/javascript' src='/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js'></script> <script> // Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3 </script> ```  ---  To use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:  ```bash npm install imurmurhash ```  Then simply include it in your scripts:  ```javascript MurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash'); ```  Quick Example -------------  ```javascript // Create the initial hash var hashState = MurmurHash3('string');  // Incrementally add text hashState.hash('more strings'); hashState.hash('even more strings');  // All calls can be chained if desired hashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');  // Get a result hashState.result(); // returns 0xe4ccfe6b ```  Functions ---------  ### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed]) Get a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:  ```javascript // Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same // object (but reset, so the current state would be lost) hashState = MurmurHash3(); ...  // Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the // function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss // will occur, at the cost of creating more objects. hashState = new MurmurHash3(); ```  Both methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.  ---  ### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string) Incrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.  ---  ### MurmurHash3.prototype.result () Get the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.  ```javascript // Do the whole string at once MurmurHash3('this is a test string').result(); // 0x70529328  // Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part var m = MurmurHash3('this is a'); m.result(); // 0xbfc4f834 m.hash(' test string').result(); // 0x70529328 (same as above) ```  ---  ### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed]) Reset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.  ---  License (MIT) ------------- Copyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

GPL version 3 =============                      GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE                        Version 3, 29 June 2007   Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.                              Preamble    The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.    The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to your programs, too.    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.    To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.    Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.    For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.    Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.    Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.                         TERMS AND CONDITIONS    0. Definitions.    'This License' refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.    'Copyright' also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.    'The Program' refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.  Each licensee is addressed as 'you'.  'Licensees' and 'recipients' may be individuals or organizations.    To 'modify' a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a 'modified version' of the earlier work or a work 'based on' the earlier work.    A 'covered work' means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.    To 'propagate' a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.    To 'convey' a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.    An interactive user interface displays 'Appropriate Legal Notices' to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.    1. Source Code.    The 'source code' for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  'Object code' means any non-source form of a work.    A 'Standard Interface' means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.    The 'System Libraries' of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A 'Major Component', in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.    The 'Corresponding Source' for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.    The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.    The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.    2. Basic Permissions.    All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.    You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.    3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.    No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.    When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.    4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.    You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.    5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.    You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified     it, and giving a relevant date.      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is     released under this License and any conditions added under section     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to     'keep intact all notices'.      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your     work need not make them do so.    A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an 'aggregate' if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.    6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.    You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium     customarily used for software interchange.      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord     with subsection 6b.      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no     charge under subsection 6d.    A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.    A 'User Product' is either (1) a 'consumer product', which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user, 'normally used' refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.    'Installation Information' for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.    If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).    The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.    Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.    7. Additional Terms.    'Additional permissions' are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.    When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal     Notices displayed by works containing it; or      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or     authors of the material; or      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on     those licensors and authors.    All other non-permissive additional terms are considered 'further restrictions' within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.    If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.    Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.    8. Termination.    You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.    9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.    10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.    An 'entity transaction' is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.    You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.    11. Patents.    A 'contributor' is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The work thus licensed is called the contributor's 'contributor version'.    A contributor's 'essential patent claims' are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, 'control' includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.    In the following three paragraphs, a 'patent license' is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To 'grant' such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.  'Knowingly relying' means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.    A patent license is 'discriminatory' if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.    12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.    13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.    14. Revised Versions of this License.    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License 'or any later version' applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.    Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.    15. Disclaimer of Warranty.    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM 'AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a     cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a     Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or     contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to     You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such     litigation is filed.  4. Redistribution.      You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works     thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or     Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:      1. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a     copy of this License; and      2. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating     that You changed the files; and      3. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You     distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from     the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain     to any part of the Derivative Works; and      4. If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its distribution,     then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy     of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding     those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works,     in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file     distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or     documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a     display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such     third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are     for informational purposes only and do not modify the License.     You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You     distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,     provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed     as modifying the License.      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may     provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,     reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such     Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and     distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions     stated in this License.  5. Submission of Contributions.      Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally     submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under     the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional     terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall     supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may     have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.  6. Trademarks.      This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,     service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for     reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and     reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.  7. Disclaimer of Warranty.      Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor     provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions)     on an 'AS IS' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,     either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties     or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS     FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the     appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks     associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.  8. Limitation of Liability.      In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort     (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by     applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed     to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages,     including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential     damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of     the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages     for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction,     or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such     Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.      While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose     to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,     indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with     this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only     on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any     other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold     each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims     asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such     warranty or additional liability.

[The MIT License](http://lauri.rooden.ee/mit-license.txt)","[Build]:    http://img.shields.io/travis/litejs/natural-compare-lite.png [Coverage]: http://img.shields.io/coveralls/litejs/natural-compare-lite.png [1]: https://travis-ci.org/litejs/natural-compare-lite [2]: https://coveralls.io/r/litejs/natural-compare-lite [npm package]: https://npmjs.org/package/natural-compare-lite [GitHub repo]: https://github.com/litejs/natural-compare-lite        @version    1.4.0     @date       2015-10-26     @stability  3 - Stable   Natural Compare &ndash; [![Build][]][1] [![Coverage][]][2] ===============  Compare strings containing a mix of letters and numbers in the way a human being would in sort order. This is described as a 'natural ordering'.  ```text Standard sorting:   Natural order sorting:     img1.png            img1.png     img10.png           img2.png     img12.png           img10.png     img2.png            img12.png ```  String.naturalCompare returns a number indicating whether a reference string comes before or after or is the same as the given string in sort order. Use it with builtin sort() function.    ### Installation  - In browser  ```html <script src=min.natural-compare.js></script> ```  - In node.js: `npm install natural-compare-lite`  ```javascript require('natural-compare-lite') ```  ### Usage  ```javascript // Simple case sensitive example var a = ['z1.doc', 'z10.doc', 'z17.doc', 'z2.doc', 'z23.doc', 'z3.doc']; a.sort(String.naturalCompare); // ['z1.doc', 'z2.doc', 'z3.doc', 'z10.doc', 'z17.doc', 'z23.doc']  // Use wrapper function for case insensitivity a.sort(function(a, b){   return String.naturalCompare(a.toLowerCase(), b.toLowerCase()); })  // In most cases we want to sort an array of objects var a = [ {'street':'350 5th Ave', 'room':'A-1021'}         , {'street':'350 5th Ave', 'room':'A-21046-b'} ];  // sort by street, then by room a.sort(function(a, b){   return String.naturalCompare(a.street, b.street) || String.naturalCompare(a.room, b.room); })  // When text transformation is needed (eg toLowerCase()), // it is best for performance to keep // transformed key in that object. // There are no need to do text transformation // on each comparision when sorting. var a = [ {'make':'Audi', 'model':'A6'}         , {'make':'Kia',  'model':'Rio'} ];  // sort by make, then by model a.map(function(car){   car.sort_key = (car.make + ' ' + car.model).toLowerCase(); }) a.sort(function(a, b){   return String.naturalCompare(a.sort_key, b.sort_key); }) ```  - Works well with dates in ISO format eg 'Rev 2012-07-26.doc'.   ### Custom alphabet  It is possible to configure a custom alphabet to achieve a desired order.  ```javascript // Estonian alphabet String.alphabet = 'ABDEFGHIJKLMNOPRSŠZŽTUVÕÄÖÜXYabdefghijklmnoprsšzžtuvõäöüxy' ['t', 'z', 'x', 'õ'].sort(String.naturalCompare) // ['z', 't', 'õ', 'x']  // Russian alphabet String.alphabet = 'АБВГДЕЁЖЗИЙКЛМНОПРСТУФХЦЧШЩЪЫЬЭЮЯабвгдеёжзийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя' ['Ё', 'А', 'Б'].sort(String.naturalCompare) // ['А', 'Б', 'Ё'] ```   External links --------------  -   [GitHub repo][https://github.com/litejs/natural-compare-lite] -   [jsperf test](http://jsperf.com/natural-sort-2/12)   Licence -------  Copyright (c) 2012-2015 Lauri Rooden &lt;lauri@rooden.ee&gt;   [The MIT License](http://lauri.rooden.ee/mit-license.txt)"

"node-idevice@0.1.6","","BSD*","","# node-idevice  Install apps to your ios device with node.  This project depends on ideviceinstaller from the [libimobiledevice](http://www.libimobiledevice.org/) project. The currently preferred way of obtaining the binary is to use brew. ``` brew install ideviceinstaller ``` You can then tell node-idevice to use the command: ```javascript // Use executable found in your $PATH var device = new IDevice();  // Or you can manually set the executable var device = new IDevice(false, {cmd: './path/to/ideviceinstaller'}); ```  If you want to build the binary yourself you can try: ``` ./utils/steps ``` This should pull and build all the dependencies. Be warned this is pretty long.  We currently support installing, removing and listing apps on a device. ### Installing ```javascript var ipa = path.resolve(__dirname, '../path/to/your/App.ipa'); device.install(ipa, function (err) { 	// Do stuff when app is installed });  // If you want to be sure the callback executes with the app on device you can use device.installAndWait(ipa, 'domain.organisation.App', function (err, success) {     // Do stuff when app is on device and ready }) ``` ### Note ideviceinstaller consumes IPA packages, please see the [docs](https://github.com/OniOni/node-idevice/blob/master/docs/building_ipa.md) on how to get an IPA from your App.  ### Removing ```javascript device.remove('domain.organisation.App', function (err) { 	// Do stuff when app is installed }); ``` ### Checking if an app is Installed ```javascript device.isInstalled(appName, function (err, installed) { 	// Installed is true when app is found on device }); ``` ### Listing Installed apps ```javascript device.listInstalled(function (err, data) { 	// data is a list of objects, one per app 	// The object contains info about the app, currently 'name' and 'fullname' }); ```"

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

"packet-reader@1.0.0","https://github.com/brianc/node-packet-reader","MIT","Copyright 2015 Brian M. Carlson. All rights reserved.","node-packet-reader ==================  Handy little well tested module for reading length-prefixed binary packets.  Since buffers come off a socket in randomly sized chunks you can't expect them to cleanly break on packet boundaries.  This module allows you to push buffers in and read full packets out the other side, so you can get to parsing right away and not have to manage concatenating partial buffers and searching through them for packets.  ## install  ` $ npm install packet-reader `  ## example  ```js var Reader = require('packet-reader')  var reader = new Reader() //assuming you have a socket emitting `data` events socket.on('data', function(buffer) {   reader.addChunk(buffer)   var packet = reader.read()   while(packet) {     //do something with fully parsed packet   } }) ```   here's a more full featured example:  let's assume our 'packet' for our protocol is 32-bit Big Endian length-prefixed strings so a 'hello world' packet would look something like [length, string] `[0, 0, 0 0x0B, h, e, l, l, o, w, o, r, l, d]`  ```js var Transform = require('stream').Transform var Reader = require('packet-reader') var reader = new Reader() var parser = new Transform() parser._transform = function(chunk, encoding, cb) {   reader.addChunk(chunk)   var packet = reader.read()   while(packet) {     this.push(packet.toString('utf8'))     packet = reader.read()   }   cb() }  var server = net.createServer(function(socket) {   socket.pipe(parser).pipe(stdout) })  ```  There are a few config options for setting optional pre-length padding byte.  Read the tests for details.  ## License  MIT  Copyright 2015 Brian M. Carlson All rights reserved.

"parse-bmfont-ascii@1.0.6","https://github.com/mattdesl/parse-bmfont-ascii","MIT","","# parse-bmfont-ascii  [![stable](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/stable.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)  Parses ASCII (text) [BMFont files](http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/).  Takes a string or Buffer:  ```js var fs = require('fs') var parse = require('parse-bmfont-xml')  fs.readFileSync(__dirname+'/Arial.fnt', function(err, data) {   var result = parse(data)   console.log(result.info.face)   // 'Arial'   console.log(result.pages)       // [ 'sheet0.png' ]   console.log(result.chars)       // [ ... char data ... ]   console.log(result.kernings)    // [ ... kernings data ... ] }) ```  The spec for the returned JSON object is [here](https://github.com/mattdesl/bmfont2json/wiki/JsonSpec). The input data should match the spec, see [test/Nexa Light-32.fnt](test/Nexa Light-32.fnt) for an example.  ## See Also  See [text-modules](https://github.com/mattdesl/text-modules) for related modules.  ## Usage  [![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/parse-bmfont-ascii.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parse-bmfont-ascii)  #### `result = parse(data)`  Parses `data`, a string or Buffer that represents ASCII (text) data of an AngelCode BMFont file. The returned `result` object looks like this:  ```js {      pages: [          'sheet_0.png',           'sheet_1.png'      ],      chars: [          { chnl, height, id, page, width, x, y, xoffset, yoffset, xadvance },          ...      ],      info: { ... },      common: { ... },      kernings: [          { first, second, amount }      ] } ```  ## License  MIT, see [LICENSE.md](http://github.com/mattdesl/parse-bmfont-ascii/blob/master/LICENSE.md) for details."

"parse-listing@1.1.3","https://github.com/sergi/parse-listing","MIT","Copyright(c) 2013 Sergi Mansilla <sergi.mansilla AT gmail.com>","## parse-listing [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/sergi/parse-listing.png)](http://travis-ci.org/sergi/parse-listing)  Simple library that parses file listing input for different platforms. An example file listing is the output of the `ls` command in unix, or the `dir` command in DOS/Windows platforms.  ## Example  ```javascript var Parser = require('parse-listing');  // Yeah yeah, multiline strings would make Crockford mad, I know. var str = 'drwxr-xr-x    5 1001     1001         4096 Jan 09 11:52 .\r\n\ drwxr-xr-x    4 0        0            4096 Sep 19 13:50 ..\r\n\ -rw-------    1 1001     1001         1118 Jan 09 12:09 .bash_history\r\n\ -rw-------    1 1001     1001          943 Jan 09 11:52 .viminfo\r\n\ drwxrwxr-x    5 1001     1001         4096 Jan 09 11:52 inaccessible\r\n\ drwxrwxrwx    2 1001     1001         4096 Sep 21 11:20 project1\r\n\ drwx------    2 1001     1001         4096 Oct 19 16:17 project2\r\n';  Parser.parseEntries(str, function(err, entryArray) {   entryArray.forEach(function(entry, i) {     console.log('Name:',entry.name);     console.log('Type', entry.type);     console.log('Size:', entry.size);   }); }); ```  The example above will print the name, type and size for every entry in the listing. A parsed line becomes a JavaScript object like this:  ```javascript   {     type: 1,     size: 4096,     name: 'project2',     time: 1382192220000,     owner: '1001',     group: '1001',      userPermissions: {       read: true,       write: true,       exec: true     },      groupPermissions: {       read: false,       write: false,       exec: false     },      otherPermissions: {       read: false,       write: false,       exec: false     }   } ```  ## Methods  ### parseEntries(string | array, callback)  Asynchronously parses a list of entries either in a single string (entries will be split by newlines) or in an array of strings. Invokes the callback when all the entries have been processed, and passes an array of JavaScript objects.  ### parseEntry(string)  Parses a single string such as:  `drwxrwxrwx    2 1001     1001         4096 Sep 21 11:20 project`  and returns the JavaScript object for it. There is no need to specify whether the entry is in UNIX or MS-DOS/Windows format. The parser will find out by itself.  ## Installation  With NPM:      npm install parse-listing  From GitHub:      git clone https://github.com/sergi/parse-listing.git  ## License  The MIT License  Copyright(c) 2013 Sergi Mansilla <sergi.mansilla AT gmail.com>  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

"pg-types@2.2.0","https://github.com/brianc/node-pg-types","MIT","Copyright (c) 2014 Brian M. Carlson","# pg-types  This is the code that turns all the raw text from postgres into JavaScript types for [node-postgres](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres.git)  ## use  This module is consumed and exported from the root `pg` object of node-postgres.  To access it, do the following:  ```js var types = require('pg').types ```  Generally what you'll want to do is override how a specific data-type is parsed and turned into a JavaScript type.  By default the PostgreSQL backend server returns everything as strings.  Every data type corresponds to a unique `OID` within the server, and these `OIDs` are sent back with the query response.  So, you need to match a particluar `OID` to a function you'd like to use to take the raw text input and produce a valid JavaScript object as a result. `null` values are never parsed.  Let's do something I commonly like to do on projects: return 64-bit integers `(int8)` as JavaScript integers.  Because JavaScript doesn't have support for 64-bit integers node-postgres cannot confidently parse `int8` data type results as numbers because if you have a _huge_ number it will overflow and the result you'd get back from node-postgres would not be the result in the datbase.  That would be a __very bad thing__ so node-postgres just returns `int8` results as strings and leaves the parsing up to you.  Let's say that you know you don't and wont ever have numbers greater than `int4` in your database, but you're tired of recieving results from the `COUNT(*)` function as strings (because that function returns `int8`).  You would do this:  ```js var types = require('pg').types types.setTypeParser(20, function(val) {   return parseInt(val) }) ```  __boom__: now you get numbers instead of strings.  Just as another example -- not saying this is a good idea -- let's say you want to return all dates from your database as [moment](http://momentjs.com/docs/) objects.  Okay, do this:  ```js var types = require('pg').types var moment = require('moment') var parseFn = function(val) {    return val === null ? null : moment(val) } types.setTypeParser(types.builtins.TIMESTAMPTZ, parseFn) types.setTypeParser(types.builtins.TIMESTAMP, parseFn) ``` _note: I've never done that with my dates, and I'm not 100% sure moment can parse all the date strings returned from postgres.  It's just an example!_  If you're thinking 'gee, this seems pretty handy, but how can I get a list of all the OIDs in the database and what they correspond to?!?!?!' worry not:  ```bash $ psql -c 'select typname, oid, typarray from pg_type order by oid' ```  If you want to find out the OID of a specific type:  ```bash $ psql -c 'select typname, oid, typarray from pg_type where typname = 'daterange' order by oid' ```  :smile:  ## license  The MIT License (MIT)  Copyright (c) 2014 Brian M.

"pgpass@1.0.2","https://github.com/hoegaarden/pgpass","MIT","Copyright (c) 2013-2016 Hannes Hörl","# pgpass  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hoegaarden/pgpass.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hoegaarden/pgpass)  ## Install  ```sh npm install pgpass ```  ## Usage ```js var pgPass = require('pgpass');  var connInfo = {   'host' : 'pgserver' ,   'user' : 'the_user_name' , };  pgPass(connInfo, function(pass){   conn_info.password = pass;   // connect to postgresql server }); ```  ## Description  This module tries to read the `~/.pgpass` file (or the equivalent for windows systems). If the environment variable `PGPASSFILE` is set, this file is used instead. If everything goes right, the password from said file is passed to the callback; if the password cannot be read `undefined` is passed to the callback.  Cases where `undefined` is returned:  - the environment variable `PGPASSWORD` is set - the file cannot be read (wrong permissions, no such file, ...) - for non windows systems: the file is write-/readable by the group or by other users - there is no matching line for the given connection info  There should be no need to use this module directly; it is already included in `node-postgresq`.  ## Configuration  The module reads the environment variable `PGPASS_NO_DEESCAPE` to decide if the the read tokens from the password file should be de-escaped or not. Default is to do de-escaping. For further information on this see [this commit](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/commit/8d15e3ec4fcb735875a8a70a09ec0c62153c3329).   ## Tests  There are tests in `./test/`; including linting and coverage testing. Running `npm test` runs:  - `jshint` - `mocha` tests - `jscoverage` and `mocha -R html-cov`  You can see the coverage report in `coverage.html`.   ## Development, Patches, Bugs, ...  If you find Bugs or have improvments, please feel free to open a issue on github. If you provide a pull request, I'm more than happy to merge them, just make sure to add tests for your changes.  ## Links  - https://github.com/hoegaarden/node-pgpass - http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-pgpass.html - https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Pgpass - https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/interfaces/libpq/fe-connect.c  ## License  Copyright (c) 2013-2016 Hannes Hörl  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

"stream-buffers@2.2.0","https://github.com/samcday/node-stream-buffer","Unlicense","","# Node Stream Buffers  [![Build Status][badge-travis-img]][badge-travis-url] [![Code Climate][badge-climate-img]][badge-climate-url] [![Code Coverage][badge-coverage-img]][badge-coverage-url]  Simple Readable and Writable Streams that use a [Buffer][node-buffer-docs] to store received data, or for data to send out. Useful for test code, debugging, and a wide range of other utilities.  ## Installation  [![NPM][badge-npm-img]][badge-npm-url]  ## Usage  To use the stream buffers in your module, simply import it and away you go.  ```js var streamBuffers = require('stream-buffers'); ```  ### Writable StreamBuffer  Writable Stream Buffers implement the standardized writable stream interface. All write()'s to this object will accumulate in an internal Buffer. If the Buffer overflows it will be resized larger automatically. The initial size of the Buffer and the amount in which it grows can be configured in the constructor.  ```js var myWritableStreamBuffer = new streamBuffers.WritableStreamBuffer({ 	initialSize: (100 * 1024),		// start as 100 kilobytes. 	incrementAmount: (10 * 1024)	// grow by 10 kilobytes each time buffer overflows. }); ```  The default initial size and increment amount are stored in the following constants:  ```js streamBuffers.DEFAULT_INITIAL_SIZE 		// (8 * 1024) streamBuffers.DEFAULT_INCREMENT_AMOUNT	// (8 * 1024) ```  Writing is standard Stream stuff:  ```js myWritableStreamBuffer.write(myBuffer); // - or - myWritableStreamBuffer.write('\u00bd + \u00bc = \u00be', 'utf8'); ```  You can query the size of the data being held in the Buffer, and also how big the Buffer's max capacity currently is:   ```js myWritableStreamBuffer.write('ASDF'); streamBuffers.size();			// 4. streamBuffers.maxSize();		// Whatever was configured as initial size. In our example: (100 * 1024). ```  Retrieving the contents of the Buffer is simple:  ```js myWritableStreamBuffer.getContents();					// Gets all held data as a Buffer. myWritableStreamBuffer.getContentsAsString('utf8');		// Gets all held data as a utf8 string. myWritableStreamBuffer.getContents(5);					// Gets first 5 bytes as a Buffer. myWritableStreamBuffer.getContentsAsString('utf8', 5);	// Gets first 5 bytes as a utf8 string. ```  Care should be taken when getting encoded strings from WritableStream, as it doesn't really care about the contents (multi-byte characters will not be respected).   Destroying or ending the WritableStream will not delete the contents of Buffer, but will disallow any further writes:  ```js myWritableStreamBuffer.write('ASDF'); myWritableStreamBuffer.destroy();  myWritableStreamBuffer.getContents();		// Returns ASDF in Buffer. myWritableStreamBuffer.write('Yeah?');		// No effect. ```	  ### Readable StreamBuffer  Readable Stream Buffers can have data inserted in them, which will then be pumped out via standard readable stream data events. The data to be sent out is held in a Buffer, which can grow in much the same way as a WritableStream Buffer does, if data is being put in Buffer faster than it's being pumped out.   The frequency in which chunks are pumped out, and the size of the chunks themselves can be configured in the constructor. The initial size and increment amount of internal Buffer can be configured too.  ```js var myReadableStreamBuffer = new streamBuffers.ReadableStreamBuffer({ 	frequency: 10,		// in milliseconds. 	chunkSize: 2048		// in bytes. }); ```  Default frequency and chunk size:  ```js streamBuffers.DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE 		// (1024) streamBuffers.DEFAULT_FREQUENCY			// (1) ```  Putting data in Buffer to be pumped out is easy:  ```js myReadableStreamBuffer.put(aBuffer); myReadableStreamBuffer.put('A String', 'utf8'); ```  Chunks are pumped out via standard readable stream spec:   ```js myReadableStreamBuffer.on('data', function(data) { 	// Yup. 	assert.isTrue(data instanceof Buffer); }); ```  Chunks are pumped out by the interval that you specified in frequency. Setting the frequency to 0 will immediately stream the data (also in chunks), even if the stream has not been piped to a destination. This is useful for unit testing.   setEncoding() for streams is respected too:  ```js myReadableStreamBuffer.setEncoding('utf8'); myReadableStreamBuffer.on('data', function(data) { 	assert.isTrue(data instanceof String); }); ```  Pause and resume are also implemented. pause()'ing stream will allow buffer to continue accumulating, but will not pump any of that data out until it is resume()'d again.   Destroying the stream will immediately purge the buffer, unless destroySoon() is called, in which case the rest of the buffer will be written out. Either way, any further attempts to put data in the Buffer will be silently ignored.   ```js myReadableStreamBuffer.destroySoon(); myReadableStreamBuffer.put('A String!'); myReadableStreamBuffer.size();			// will be 0. ```  ## Disclaimer  Not supposed to be a speed demon, it's more for tests/debugging or weird edge cases. It works with an internal buffer that it copies contents to/from/around.  ## Contributors  Thanks to the following people for taking some time to contribute to this project.   * Igor Dralyuk <idralyuk@ebay.com>  * Simon Koudijs <simon.koudijs@intellifi.nl>  ## License  node-stream-buffer is free and unencumbered public domain software.

All writes to this stream will accumulate in an internal [`Buffer`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html). If the internal buffer overflows it will be resized automatically.

This data will then be pumped out in chunks as readable events. The data to be sent out is held in a Buffer, which can grow in much the same way as a `WritableStreamBuffer` does, if data is being put in Buffer faster than it is being pumped out.   The frequency in which chunks are pumped out, and the size of the chunks themselves can be configured in the constructor. The initial size and increment amount of internal Buffer can be configured too. In the following example 2kb chunks will be output every 10 milliseconds:  ```js var myReadableStreamBuffer = new streamBuffers.ReadableStreamBuffer({ 	frequency: 10,   // in milliseconds. 	chunkSize: 2048  // in bytes. }); ```  Default frequency and chunk size:  ```js streamBuffers.DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE  // (1024) streamBuffers.DEFAULT_FREQUENCY   // (1) ```  Putting data in Buffer to be pumped out is easy:  ```js myReadableStreamBuffer.put(aBuffer); myReadableStreamBuffer.put('A String', 'utf8'); ```  Chunks are pumped out via standard `stream.Readable` semantics. This means you can use the old streams1 way:  ```js myReadableStreamBuffer.on('data', function(data) {   // streams1.x style data   assert.isTrue(data instanceof Buffer); }); ```  Or the streams2+ way:  ```js myReadableStreamBuffer.on('readable', function(data) {   var chunk;   while((chunk = myReadableStreamBuffer.read()) !== null) {     assert.isTrue(chunk instanceof Buffer);   } }); ```  Because `ReadableStreamBuffer` is simply an implementation of [`stream.Readable`](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable), it implements pause / resume / setEncoding / etc.  Once you're done putting data into a `ReadableStreamBuffer`, you can call `stop()` on it.  ```js myReadableStreamBuffer.put('the last data this stream will ever see'); myReadableStreamBuffer.stop(); ```  Once the `ReadableStreamBuffer` is done pumping out the data in its internal buffer, it will emit the usual [`end`](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_event_end) event. You cannot write any more data to the stream once you've called `stop()` on it.  ## Disclaimer  Not supposed to be a speed demon, it's more for tests/debugging or weird edge cases. It works with an internal buffer that it copies contents to/from/around.  ## Contributors  Thanks to the following people for taking some time to contribute to this project.   * Igor Dralyuk <idralyuk@ebay.com>  * Simon Koudijs <simon.koudijs@intellifi.nl>  ## License  node-stream-buffer is free and unencumbered public domain software.

Correctly handles multi-byte characters and surrogate pairs.  A browser implementation that doesn't use `Buffer.byteLength` is provided to minimize build size.  ## Example  ```js var truncate = require('truncate-utf8-bytes') var str = 'a☃' // a = 1 byte, ☃ = 3 bytes console.log(truncate(str, 2)) // -> 'a' ```  ## API  ### `var truncate = require('truncate-utf8-bytes')`  *When using browserify or webpack*, this automatically resolves to an implementation that does not use `Buffer.byteLength`.  ### `truncate(string, length)`  Returns `string` truncated to at most `length` bytes in length."

The results of this function will be more specific than that of native `typeof`.  ```js var type = require('type-detect'); ```  #### array  ```js assert('array' === type([])); assert('array' === type(new Array())); ```  #### regexp  ```js assert('regexp' === type(/a-z/gi)); assert('regexp' === type(new RegExp('a-z'))); ```  #### function  ```js assert('function' === type(function () {})); ```  #### arguments  ```js (function () {   assert('arguments' === type(arguments)); })(); ```  #### date  ```js assert('date' === type(new Date)); ```  #### number  ```js assert('number' === type(1)); assert('number' === type(1.234)); assert('number' === type(-1)); assert('number' === type(-1.234)); assert('number' === type(Infinity)); assert('number' === type(NaN)); ```  #### string  ```js assert('string' === type('hello world')); ```  #### null  ```js assert('null' === type(null)); assert('null' !== type(undefined)); ```  #### undefined  ```js assert('undefined' === type(undefined)); assert('undefined' !== type(null)); ```  #### object  ```js var Noop = function () {}; assert('object' === type({})); assert('object' !== type(Noop)); assert('object' === type(new Noop)); assert('object' === type(new Object)); assert('object' === type(new String('hello'))); ```  ### Library  A `Library` is a small constructed repository for custom type detections.  ```js var lib = new type.Library; ```  #### .of (obj)  * **@param** _{Mixed}_ object to test * **@return** _{String}_  type  Expose replacement `typeof` detection to the library.  ```js if ('string' === lib.of('hello world')) {   // ... } ```   #### .define (type, test)  * **@param** _{String}_ type  * **@param** _{RegExp|Function}_ test   Add a test to for the `.test()` assertion.  Can be defined as a regular expression:  ```js lib.define('int', /^[0-9]+$/); ```  ... or as a function:  ```js lib.define('bln', function (obj) {   if ('boolean' === lib.of(obj)) return true;   var blns = [ 'yes', 'no', 'true', 'false', 1, 0 ];   if ('string' === lib.of(obj)) obj = obj.toLowerCase();   return !! ~blns.indexOf(obj); }); ```   #### .test (obj, test)  * **@param** _{Mixed}_ object  * **@param** _{String}_ type  * **@return** _{Boolean}_  result  Assert that an object is of type. Will first check natives, and if that does not pass it will use the user defined custom tests.  ```js assert(lib.test('1', 'int')); assert(lib.test('yes', 'bln')); ```     ## License  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2013 Jake Luer <jake@alogicalparadox.com> (http://alogicalparadox.com)  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

"uri-js@4.2.2","https://github.com/garycourt/uri-js","BSD-2-Clause","Copyright 2011 Gary Court. All rights reserved.","# URI.js  URI.js is an [RFC 3986](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt) compliant, scheme extendable URI parsing/validating/resolving library for all JavaScript environments (browsers, Node.js, etc). It is also compliant with the IRI ([RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt)), IDNA ([RFC 5890](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5890.txt)), IPv6 Address ([RFC 5952](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5952.txt)), IPv6 Zone Identifier ([RFC 6874](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6874.txt)) specifications.  URI.js has an extensive test suite, and works in all (Node.js, web) environments. It weighs in at 6.2kb (gzipped, 16kb deflated).  ## API  ### Parsing  	URI.parse('uri://user:pass@example.com:123/one/two.three?q1=a1&q2=a2#body'); 	//returns: 	//{ 	//  scheme : 'uri', 	//  userinfo : 'user:pass', 	//  host : 'example.com', 	//  port : 123, 	//  path : '/one/two.three', 	//  query : 'q1=a1&q2=a2', 	//  fragment : 'body' 	//}  ### Serializing  	URI.serialize({scheme : 'http', host : 'example.com', fragment : 'footer'}) === 'http://example.com/#footer'  ### Resolving  	URI.resolve('uri://a/b/c/d?q', '../../g') === 'uri://a/g'  ### Normalizing  	URI.normalize('HTTP://ABC.com:80/%7Esmith/home.html') === 'http://abc.com/~smith/home.html'  ### Comparison  	URI.equal('example://a/b/c/%7Bfoo%7D', 'eXAMPLE://a/./b/../b/%63/%7bfoo%7d') === true  ### IP Support  	//IPv4 normalization 	URI.normalize('//192.068.001.000') === '//192.68.1.0'  	//IPv6 normalization 	URI.normalize('//[2001:0:0DB8::0:0001]') === '//[2001:0:db8::1]'  	//IPv6 zone identifier support 	URI.parse('//[2001:db8::7%25en1]'); 	//returns: 	//{ 	//  host : '2001:db8::7%en1' 	//}  ### IRI Support  	//convert IRI to URI 	URI.serialize(URI.parse('http://examplé.org/rosé')) === 'http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9' 	//convert URI to IRI 	URI.serialize(URI.parse('http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9'), {iri:true}) === 'http://examplé.org/rosé'  ### Options  All of the above functions can accept an additional options argument that is an object that can contain one or more of the following properties:  *	`scheme` (string)  	Indicates the scheme that the URI should be treated as, overriding the URI's normal scheme parsing behavior.  *	`reference` (string)  	If set to `'suffix'`, it indicates that the URI is in the suffix format, and the validator will use the option's `scheme` property to determine the URI's scheme.  *	`tolerant` (boolean, false)  	If set to `true`, the parser will relax URI resolving rules.  *	`absolutePath` (boolean, false)  	If set to `true`, the serializer will not resolve a relative `path` component.  *	`iri` (boolean, false)  	If set to `true`, the serializer will unescape non-ASCII characters as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).  *	`unicodeSupport` (boolean, false)  	If set to `true`, the parser will unescape non-ASCII characters in the parsed output as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).  *	`domainHost` (boolean, false)  	If set to `true`, the library will treat the `host` component as a domain name, and convert IDNs (International Domain Names) as per [RFC 5891](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5891.txt).  ## Scheme Extendable  URI.js supports inserting custom [scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme) dependent processing rules. Currently, URI.js has built in support for the following schemes:  *	http \[[RFC 2616](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt)\] *	https \[[RFC 2818](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2818.txt)\] *	mailto \[[RFC 6068](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6068.txt)\] *	urn \[[RFC 2141](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt)\] *	urn:uuid \[[RFC 4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt)\]  ### HTTP Support  	URI.equal('HTTP://ABC.COM:80', 'http://abc.com/') === true  ### Mailto Support  	URI.parse('mailto:alpha@example.com,bravo@example.com?subject=SUBSCRIBE&body=Sign%20me%20up!'); 	//returns: 	//{ 	//	scheme : 'mailto', 	//	to : ['alpha@example.com', 'bravo@example.com'], 	//	subject : 'SUBSCRIBE', 	//	body : 'Sign me up!' 	//}  	URI.serialize({ 		scheme : 'mailto', 		to : ['alpha@example.com'], 		subject : 'REMOVE', 		body : 'Please remove me', 		headers : { 			cc : 'charlie@example.com' 		} 	}) === 'mailto:alpha@example.com?cc=charlie@example.com&subject=REMOVE&body=Please%20remove%20me'  ### URN Support  	URI.parse('urn:example:foo'); 	//returns: 	//{ 	//	scheme : 'urn', 	//	nid : 'example', 	//	nss : 'foo', 	//}  #### URN UUID Support  	URI.parse('urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6'); 	//returns: 	//{ 	//	scheme : 'urn', 	//	nid : 'example', 	//	uuid : 'f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6', 	//}  ## Usage  To load in a browser, use the following tag:  	<script type='text/javascript' src='uri-js/dist/es5/uri.all.min.js'></script>  To load in a CommonJS (Node.js) environment, first install with npm by running on the command line:  	npm install uri-js  Then, in your code, load it using:  	const URI = require('uri-js');  If you are writing your code in ES6+ (ESNEXT) or TypeScript, you would load it using:  	import * as URI from 'uri-js';  Or you can load just what you need using named exports:  	import { parse, serialize, resolve, resolveComponents, normalize, equal, removeDotSegments, pctEncChar, pctDecChars, escapeComponent, unescapeComponent } from 'uri-js';  ## Breaking changes  ### Breaking changes from 3.x  URN parsing has been completely changed to better align with the specification. Scheme is now always `urn`, but has two new properties: `nid` which contains the Namspace Identifier, and `nss` which contains the Namespace Specific String. The `nss` property will be removed by higher order scheme handlers, such as the UUID URN scheme handler.  The UUID of a URN can now be found in the `uuid` property.  ### Breaking changes from 2.x  URI validation has been removed as it was slow, exposed a vulnerabilty, and was generally not useful.  ### Breaking changes from 1.x  The `errors` array on parsed components is now an `error` string.  ## License ([Simplified BSD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses#2-clause))  Copyright 2011 Gary Court.

'Contributor' shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and       subsequently incorporated within the Work.     2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

"webdriverio@6.10.11","https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio","MIT","","WebdriverIO ===========  > Next-gen browser and mobile automation test framework for Node.js  This package provides and easy to manage API and a lot of syntactical sugar on top of the WebDriver specification. You can use WebdriverIO as a standalone package or via a testrunner using [`@wdio/cli`](https://webdriver.io/docs/clioptions.html). WebdriverIO allows to run tests locally using the WebDriver or Chrome DevTools protocol as well as remote user agents using cloud providers like [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/).  ## Installation  You can install WebdriverIO via NPM:  ```sh $ npm install webdriverio ```  ## Usage  WebdriverIO by default uses Puppeteer to automate a browser like Chrome, Firefox or Chromium Edge. So if you have these installs the following script should start a browser for you and get the title of the page:  ```js import { remote } from 'webdriverio'  let browser  ;(async () => {     browser = await remote({         capabilities: { browserName: 'chrome' }     })      await browser.navigateTo('https://www.google.com/ncr')      const searchInput = await browser.$('#lst-ib')     await searchInput.setValue('WebdriverIO')      const searchBtn = await browser.$('input[value='Google Search']')     await searchBtn.click()      console.log(await browser.getTitle()) // outputs 'WebdriverIO - Google Search'      await browser.deleteSession() })().catch((err) => {     console.error(err)     return browser.deleteSession() }) ```  See the raw [protocol example](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webdriver#example) using the `webdriver` package to get a glance on the differences.

For the purposes of this definition, 'submitted'       means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent       to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to       communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,       and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the       Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but       excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise       designated in writing by the copyright owner as 'Not a Contribution.'        'Contributor' shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and       subsequently incorporated within the Work.     2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Rowling'><title>Harry Potter</title></book>' var doc = new dom().parseFromString(xml) var result = xpath.evaluate(     '/book/title',            // xpathExpression     doc,                        // contextNode     null,                       // namespaceResolver     xpath.XPathResult.ANY_TYPE, // resultType     null                        // result )  node = result.iterateNext(); while (node) {     console.log(node.localName + ': ' + node.firstChild.data);     console.log('Node: ' + node.toString());      node = result.iterateNext(); } ````` ➡      title: Harry Potter     Node: <title>Harry Potter</title>  ## Evaluate string values directly: `````javascript var xml = '<book><title>Harry Potter</title></book>'; var doc = new dom().parseFromString(xml); var title = xpath.select('string(//title)', doc);  console.log(title); ````` ➡      Harry Potter  ## Namespaces `````javascript var xml = '<book><title xmlns='myns'>Harry Potter</title></book>' var doc = new dom().parseFromString(xml) var node = xpath.select('//*[local-name(.)='title' and namespace-uri(.)='myns']', doc)[0]  console.log(node.namespaceURI) ````` ➡      myns  ## Namespaces with easy mappings `````javascript var xml = '<book xmlns:bookml='http://example.com/book'><bookml:title>Harry Potter</bookml:title></book>' var select = xpath.useNamespaces({'bookml': 'http://example.com/book'});  console.log(select('//bookml:title/text()', doc)[0].nodeValue); ````` ➡      Harry Potter  ## Default namespace with mapping `````javascript var xml = '<book xmlns='http://example.com/book'><title>Harry Potter</title></book>' var select = xpath.useNamespaces({'bookml': 'http://example.com/book'});  console.log(select('//bookml:title/text()', doc)[0].nodeValue); ````` ➡      Harry Potter  ## Attributes `````javascript var xml = '<book author='J. K. Rowling'><title>Harry Potter</title></book>' var doc = new dom().parseFromString(xml) var author = xpath.select1('/book/@author', doc).value  console.log(author) ````` ➡      J. K. Rowling  [MDN]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Document/evaluate  ## License MIT"
