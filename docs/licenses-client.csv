Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works (“Commons”) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.  For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.  1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be    protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and    Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited    to, the following:    1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,       and translate a Work;    2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);    3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness       depicted in a Work;    4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,       subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;    5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in       a Work;    6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the       European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal       protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,       including any amended or successor version of such directive); and    7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world       based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations       thereof.  2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,    applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and    unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright    and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now    known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of    action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum    duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time    extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of    copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation    commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer    makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and    to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that    such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,    termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet    enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express    Statement of Purpose.  3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be    judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver    shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account    Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the    Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a    royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,    irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and    Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the    maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time    extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of    copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation    commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License    shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the    Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally    invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or    ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in    such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any    of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)    assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,    in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.  4. Limitations and Disclaimers.    1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,       surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.    2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties       of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or       otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,       merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or       the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or       absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest       extent permissible under applicable law.    3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons       that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without       limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.       Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary       consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.    4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a       party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this       CC0 or use of the Work.

'Object' form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical       transformation or translation of a Source form, including but       not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,       and conversions to other media types.        'Work' shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or       Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a       copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work       (an example is provided in the Appendix below).        'Derivative Works' shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.        'Contribution' shall mean any work of authorship, including       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of       the copyright owner.

'Contributor' shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and       subsequently incorporated within the Work.     2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS     APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

For the purposes of this definition, 'submitted'    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,    and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the    Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but    excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise    designated in writing by the copyright owner as 'Not a Contribution.'     'Contributor' shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and    subsequently incorporated within the Work.  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate    as of the date such litigation is filed.  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You    meet the following conditions:     (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and     (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices        stating that You changed the files; and     (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of        the Derivative Works; and     (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed        as modifying the License.     You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with    the conditions stated in this License.  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

'Derivative Works' shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.        'Contribution' shall mean any work of authorship, including       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of       the copyright owner.

'Contributor' shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and       subsequently incorporated within the Work.     2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

"assert-plus@1.0.0","https://github.com/mcavage/node-assert-plus","MIT","","# assert-plus  This library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two things: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable NODE\_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like `assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks like this:  ```javascript     var assert = require('assert-plus');      function fooAccount(options, callback) {         assert.object(options, 'options');         assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');         assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');         assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');         assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');         assert.func(callback, 'callback');          // Do stuff         callback(null, {});     } ```  # API  All methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to take an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError` will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:      AssertionError: foo (string) is required     at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)     at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)     at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)     at Object..js (module.js:464:10)     at Module.load (module.js:353:31)     at Function._load (module.js:311:12)     at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)     at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)  from:  ```javascript     function test(foo) {         assert.string(foo, 'foo');     } ```  There you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:  ```javascript     function test(foo) {         assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');     } ```  You can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):  ```javascript     assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo'); ```  Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the environment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have lots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in production.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are also disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from the `assert` module avoids this behavior.  The complete list of APIs is:  * assert.array * assert.bool * assert.buffer * assert.func * assert.number * assert.finite * assert.object * assert.string * assert.stream * assert.date * assert.regexp * assert.uuid * assert.arrayOfArray * assert.arrayOfBool * assert.arrayOfBuffer * assert.arrayOfFunc * assert.arrayOfNumber * assert.arrayOfFinite * assert.arrayOfObject * assert.arrayOfString * assert.arrayOfStream * assert.arrayOfDate * assert.arrayOfRegexp * assert.arrayOfUuid * assert.optionalArray * assert.optionalBool * assert.optionalBuffer * assert.optionalFunc * assert.optionalNumber * assert.optionalFinite * assert.optionalObject * assert.optionalString * assert.optionalStream * assert.optionalDate * assert.optionalRegexp * assert.optionalUuid * assert.optionalArrayOfArray * assert.optionalArrayOfBool * assert.optionalArrayOfBuffer * assert.optionalArrayOfFunc * assert.optionalArrayOfNumber * assert.optionalArrayOfFinite * assert.optionalArrayOfObject * assert.optionalArrayOfString * assert.optionalArrayOfStream * assert.optionalArrayOfDate * assert.optionalArrayOfRegexp * assert.optionalArrayOfUuid * assert.AssertionError * assert.fail * assert.ok * assert.equal * assert.notEqual * assert.deepEqual * assert.notDeepEqual * assert.strictEqual * assert.notStrictEqual * assert.throws * assert.doesNotThrow * assert.ifError  # Installation      npm install assert-plus  ## License  The MIT License (MIT) Copyright (c) 2012 Mark Cavage  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

"ast-types-flow@0.0.7","https://github.com/kyldvs/ast-types-flow","ISC","","# ast-types-flow  Flow types for the Javascript AST. Based off of [benjamn/ast-types](https://github.com/benjamn/ast-types).  ## Usage  First install `ast-types-flow` via npm, then you can import any of the types that are exported.  ```javascript /* @flow */  import type {Node} from 'ast-types-flow';  function getName(node: Node): string {   switch (node.type) {     case 'Identifier':       return node.name;      case 'ClassDeclaration':       return node.id.name; // Error, id could be null.      case 'FunctionDeclaration':       return node.id.name; // Fine if it's always there.      case 'FunctionExpression':       if (node.id) {         return node.id.name; // Can refine id to make sure it exists.       } else {         return 'Unknown';       }      case 'Literal':       return node.name; // Error, Literals don't have names, don't be silly.   }   return 'Unknown'; } ```  ## How it works  A notion of 'extends' is added to the Flow syntax via comments. A transform is included that will compile the source code into useful disjoint union types based on how the different types extend each other. For example:  ```javascript type Node = {   common: string, };  type Foo = {   // extends Node   foo: string, };  type Bar = {   // extends Node   bar: number, }; ```  Will be transformed into:  ```javascript type Node = {   type: 'Foo',   _Foo: void,   common: string,   foo: string, } | {   type: 'Bar',   _Bar: void,   common: string,   bar: number, };  type Foo = {   type: 'Foo',   _Foo: void,   common: string,   foo: string, };  type Bar = {   type: 'Bar',   _Foo: void,   common: string,   bar: number, }; ```  A few things to note:  1. The type `Node` would more ideally be compiled into `Foo | Bar` but then the disjoint union cannot be properly refined. For now we have to duplicate the complete definitions. 2. Each entry in a disjoint union has to be structurally unique or Flow will have an error on the definition. That is why the private `_Foo: void` fields appear in the types."

No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the      distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.      Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a      Contributor:       a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or       b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's         modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its         Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor         Version); or       c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of         its Contributions.       This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,      or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with      the notice requirements in Section 3.4).  2.4. Subsequent Licenses       No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to      distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this      License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if      permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).  2.5. Representation       Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its      Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to      grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.  2.6. Fair Use       This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under      applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other      equivalents.  2.7. Conditions       Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in      Section 2.1.   3. Responsibilities  3.1. Distribution of Source Form       All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any      Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under      the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source      Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this      License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not      attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code      Form.  3.2. Distribution of Executable Form       If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:       a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,         as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the         Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by         reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost         of distribution to the recipient; and       b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this         License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the         license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the         recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.  3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work       You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,      provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for      the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered      Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the      Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this      License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software      under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of      the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered      Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary      License(s).  3.4. Notices       You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices      (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or      limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the      Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the      extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.  3.5. Application of Additional Terms       You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,      indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered      Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on      behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any      such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by      You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any      liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,      indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional      disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any      jurisdiction.  4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License    with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,    judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of    this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the    limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a    text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under    this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,    such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary    skill to be able to understand it.  5. Termination  5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You      fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,      then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor      are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor      explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing      basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by      some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into      compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are      reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the      non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have      received notice of non-compliance with this License from such      Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt      of the notice.  5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent      infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,      counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version      directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to      You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section      2.1 of this License shall terminate.  5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user      license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been      validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to      termination shall survive termination.  6. Disclaimer of Warranty     Covered Software is provided under this License on an 'as is' basis,    without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,    including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free    of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.    The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software    is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,    You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,    repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential    part of this License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under    this License except under this disclaimer.  7. Limitation of Liability     Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including    negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who    distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any    direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any    character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all    other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been    informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability    shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from    such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such    limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of    incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may    not apply to You.  8. Litigation     Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts    of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of    business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that    jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing    in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or    counter-claims.  9. Miscellaneous     This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent    necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that    the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not    be used to construe this License against a Contributor.   10. Versions of the License  10.1. New Versions        Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section       10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or       publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a       distinguishing version number.  10.2. Effect of New Versions        You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version       of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,       or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license       steward.  10.3. Modified Versions        If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to       create a new license for such software, you may create and use a       modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove       any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that       such modified license differs from this License).  10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary       Licenses If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is       Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of       the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be       attached.

Here is the list of them in the order of appearance in the function name:  * `i` - perform operation in-place, storing the result in the host object (on   which the method was invoked). Might be used to avoid number allocation costs * `u` - unsigned, ignore the sign of operands when performing operation, or   always return positive value. Second case applies to reduction operations   like `mod()`. In such cases if the result will be negative - modulo will be   added to the result to make it positive  ### Postfixes  The only available postfix at the moment is:  * `n` - which means that the argument of the function must be a plain JavaScript   Number. Decimals are not supported.  ### Examples  * `a.iadd(b)` - perform addition on `a` and `b`, storing the result in `a` * `a.umod(b)` - reduce `a` modulo `b`, returning positive value * `a.iushln(13)` - shift bits of `a` left by 13  ## Instructions  Prefixes/postfixes are put in parens at the of the line. `endian` - could be either `le` (little-endian) or `be` (big-endian).  ### Utilities  * `a.clone()` - clone number * `a.toString(base, length)` - convert to base-string and pad with zeroes * `a.toNumber()` - convert to Javascript Number (limited to 53 bits) * `a.toJSON()` - convert to JSON compatible hex string (alias of `toString(16)`) * `a.toArray(endian, length)` - convert to byte `Array`, and optionally zero   pad to length, throwing if already exceeding * `a.toArrayLike(type, endian, length)` - convert to an instance of `type`,   which must behave like an `Array` * `a.toBuffer(endian, length)` - convert to Node.js Buffer (if available). For   compatibility with browserify and similar tools, use this instead:   `a.toArrayLike(Buffer, endian, length)` * `a.bitLength()` - get number of bits occupied * `a.zeroBits()` - return number of less-significant consequent zero bits   (example: `1010000` has 4 zero bits) * `a.byteLength()` - return number of bytes occupied * `a.isNeg()` - true if the number is negative * `a.isEven()` - no comments * `a.isOdd()` - no comments * `a.isZero()` - no comments * `a.cmp(b)` - compare numbers and return `-1` (a `<` b), `0` (a `==` b), or `1` (a `>` b)   depending on the comparison result (`ucmp`, `cmpn`) * `a.lt(b)` - `a` less than `b` (`n`) * `a.lte(b)` - `a` less than or equals `b` (`n`) * `a.gt(b)` - `a` greater than `b` (`n`) * `a.gte(b)` - `a` greater than or equals `b` (`n`) * `a.eq(b)` - `a` equals `b` (`n`) * `a.toTwos(width)` - convert to two's complement representation, where `width` is bit width * `a.fromTwos(width)` - convert from two's complement representation, where `width` is the bit width * `BN.isBN(object)` - returns true if the supplied `object` is a BN.js instance  ### Arithmetics  * `a.neg()` - negate sign (`i`) * `a.abs()` - absolute value (`i`) * `a.add(b)` - addition (`i`, `n`, `in`) * `a.sub(b)` - subtraction (`i`, `n`, `in`) * `a.mul(b)` - multiply (`i`, `n`, `in`) * `a.sqr()` - square (`i`) * `a.pow(b)` - raise `a` to the power of `b` * `a.div(b)` - divide (`divn`, `idivn`) * `a.mod(b)` - reduct (`u`, `n`) (but no `umodn`) * `a.divRound(b)` - rounded division  ### Bit operations  * `a.or(b)` - or (`i`, `u`, `iu`) * `a.and(b)` - and (`i`, `u`, `iu`, `andln`) (NOTE: `andln` is going to be replaced   with `andn` in future) * `a.xor(b)` - xor (`i`, `u`, `iu`) * `a.setn(b)` - set specified bit to `1` * `a.shln(b)` - shift left (`i`, `u`, `iu`) * `a.shrn(b)` - shift right (`i`, `u`, `iu`) * `a.testn(b)` - test if specified bit is set * `a.maskn(b)` - clear bits with indexes higher or equal to `b` (`i`) * `a.bincn(b)` - add `1 << b` to the number * `a.notn(w)` - not (for the width specified by `w`) (`i`)  ### Reduction  * `a.gcd(b)` - GCD * `a.egcd(b)` - Extended GCD results (`{ a: ..., b: ..., gcd: ... }`) * `a.invm(b)` - inverse `a` modulo `b`  ## Fast reduction  When doing lots of reductions using the same modulo, it might be beneficial to use some tricks: like [Montgomery multiplication][0], or using special algorithm for [Mersenne Prime][1].  ### Reduction context  To enable this tricks one should create a reduction context:  ```js var red = BN.red(num); ``` where `num` is just a BN instance.  Or:  ```js var red = BN.red(primeName); ```  Where `primeName` is either of these [Mersenne Primes][1]:  * `'k256'` * `'p224'` * `'p192'` * `'p25519'`  Or:  ```js var red = BN.mont(num); ```  To reduce numbers with [Montgomery trick][0]. `.mont()` is generally faster than `.red(num)`, but slower than `BN.red(primeName)`.  ### Converting numbers  Before performing anything in reduction context - numbers should be converted to it. Usually, this means that one should:  * Convert inputs to reducted ones * Operate on them in reduction context * Convert outputs back from the reduction context  Here is how one may convert numbers to `red`:  ```js var redA = a.toRed(red); ``` Where `red` is a reduction context created using instructions above  Here is how to convert them back:  ```js var a = redA.fromRed(); ```  ### Red instructions  Most of the instructions from the very start of this readme have their counterparts in red context:  * `a.redAdd(b)`, `a.redIAdd(b)` * `a.redSub(b)`, `a.redISub(b)` * `a.redShl(num)` * `a.redMul(b)`, `a.redIMul(b)` * `a.redSqr()`, `a.redISqr()` * `a.redSqrt()` - square root modulo reduction context's prime * `a.redInvm()` - modular inverse of the number * `a.redNeg()` * `a.redPow(b)` - modular exponentiation  ## LICENSE  This software is licensed under the MIT License.

For   compatibility with browserify and similar tools, use this instead:   `a.toArrayLike(Buffer, endian, length)` * `a.bitLength()` - get number of bits occupied * `a.zeroBits()` - return number of less-significant consequent zero bits   (example: `1010000` has 4 zero bits) * `a.byteLength()` - return number of bytes occupied * `a.isNeg()` - true if the number is negative * `a.isEven()` - no comments * `a.isOdd()` - no comments * `a.isZero()` - no comments * `a.cmp(b)` - compare numbers and return `-1` (a `<` b), `0` (a `==` b), or `1` (a `>` b)   depending on the comparison result (`ucmp`, `cmpn`) * `a.lt(b)` - `a` less than `b` (`n`) * `a.lte(b)` - `a` less than or equals `b` (`n`) * `a.gt(b)` - `a` greater than `b` (`n`) * `a.gte(b)` - `a` greater than or equals `b` (`n`) * `a.eq(b)` - `a` equals `b` (`n`) * `a.toTwos(width)` - convert to two's complement representation, where `width` is bit width * `a.fromTwos(width)` - convert from two's complement representation, where `width` is the bit width * `BN.isBN(object)` - returns true if the supplied `object` is a BN.js instance * `BN.max(a, b)` - return `a` if `a` bigger than `b` * `BN.min(a, b)` - return `a` if `a` less than `b`  ### Arithmetics  * `a.neg()` - negate sign (`i`) * `a.abs()` - absolute value (`i`) * `a.add(b)` - addition (`i`, `n`, `in`) * `a.sub(b)` - subtraction (`i`, `n`, `in`) * `a.mul(b)` - multiply (`i`, `n`, `in`) * `a.sqr()` - square (`i`) * `a.pow(b)` - raise `a` to the power of `b` * `a.div(b)` - divide (`divn`, `idivn`) * `a.mod(b)` - reduct (`u`, `n`) (but no `umodn`) * `a.divRound(b)` - rounded division  ### Bit operations  * `a.or(b)` - or (`i`, `u`, `iu`) * `a.and(b)` - and (`i`, `u`, `iu`, `andln`) (NOTE: `andln` is going to be replaced   with `andn` in future) * `a.xor(b)` - xor (`i`, `u`, `iu`) * `a.setn(b)` - set specified bit to `1` * `a.shln(b)` - shift left (`i`, `u`, `iu`) * `a.shrn(b)` - shift right (`i`, `u`, `iu`) * `a.testn(b)` - test if specified bit is set * `a.maskn(b)` - clear bits with indexes higher or equal to `b` (`i`) * `a.bincn(b)` - add `1 << b` to the number * `a.notn(w)` - not (for the width specified by `w`) (`i`)  ### Reduction  * `a.gcd(b)` - GCD * `a.egcd(b)` - Extended GCD results (`{ a: ..., b: ..., gcd: ... }`) * `a.invm(b)` - inverse `a` modulo `b`  ## Fast reduction  When doing lots of reductions using the same modulo, it might be beneficial to use some tricks: like [Montgomery multiplication][0], or using special algorithm for [Mersenne Prime][1].  ### Reduction context  To enable this tricks one should create a reduction context:  ```js var red = BN.red(num); ``` where `num` is just a BN instance.  Or:  ```js var red = BN.red(primeName); ```  Where `primeName` is either of these [Mersenne Primes][1]:  * `'k256'` * `'p224'` * `'p192'` * `'p25519'`  Or:  ```js var red = BN.mont(num); ```  To reduce numbers with [Montgomery trick][0]. `.mont()` is generally faster than `.red(num)`, but slower than `BN.red(primeName)`.  ### Converting numbers  Before performing anything in reduction context - numbers should be converted to it. Usually, this means that one should:  * Convert inputs to reducted ones * Operate on them in reduction context * Convert outputs back from the reduction context  Here is how one may convert numbers to `red`:  ```js var redA = a.toRed(red); ``` Where `red` is a reduction context created using instructions above  Here is how to convert them back:  ```js var a = redA.fromRed(); ```  ### Red instructions  Most of the instructions from the very start of this readme have their counterparts in red context:  * `a.redAdd(b)`, `a.redIAdd(b)` * `a.redSub(b)`, `a.redISub(b)` * `a.redShl(num)` * `a.redMul(b)`, `a.redIMul(b)` * `a.redSqr()`, `a.redISqr()` * `a.redSqrt()` - square root modulo reduction context's prime * `a.redInvm()` - modular inverse of the number * `a.redNeg()` * `a.redPow(b)` - modular exponentiation  ### Number Size  Optimized for elliptic curves that work with 256-bit numbers. There is no limitation on the size of the numbers.  ## LICENSE  This software is licensed under the MIT License.  Copyright Fedor Indutny, 2015.

"boolbase@1.0.0","https://github.com/fb55/boolbase","ISC","","#boolbase This very simple module provides two basic functions, one that always returns true (`trueFunc`) and one that always returns false (`falseFunc`).  ###WTF?  By having only a single instance of these functions around, it's possible to do some nice optimizations. Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.  ###And why is this a separate module?  I'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions. IMHO, having a separate module is the easiest solution to this problem."

"bser@2.1.1","https://github.com/facebook/watchman","Apache-2.0","","# BSER Binary Serialization  BSER is a binary serialization scheme that can be used as an alternative to JSON. BSER uses a framed encoding that makes it simpler to use to stream a sequence of encoded values.  It is intended to be used for local-IPC only and strings are represented as binary with no specific encoding; this matches the convention employed by most operating system filename storage.  For more details about the serialization scheme see [Watchman's docs](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/bser.html).  ## API  ```js var bser = require('bser'); ```  ### bser.loadFromBuffer  The is the synchronous decoder; given an input string or buffer, decodes a single value and returns it.  Throws an error if the input is invalid.  ```js var obj = bser.loadFromBuffer(buf); ```  ### bser.dumpToBuffer  Synchronously encodes a value as BSER.  ```js var encoded = bser.dumpToBuffer(['hello']); console.log(bser.loadFromBuffer(encoded)); // ['hello'] ```  ### BunserBuf  The asynchronous decoder API is implemented in the BunserBuf object. You may incrementally append data to this object and it will emit the decoded values via its `value` event.  ```js var bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();  bunser.on('value', function(obj) {   console.log(obj); }); ```  Then in your socket `data` event:  ```js bunser.append(buf); ```  ## Example  Read BSER from socket:  ```js var bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();  bunser.on('value', function(obj) {   console.log('data from socket', obj); });  var socket = net.connect('/socket');  socket.on('data', function(buf) {   bunser.append(buf); }); ```  Write BSER to socket:  ```js socket.write(bser.dumpToBuffer(obj)); ```"

Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related information available on an 'as-is' basis. Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible.  Using Creative Commons Public Licenses  Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.       Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are      intended for use by those authorized to give the public      permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by      copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are      irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms      and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.      Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before      applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the      material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any      material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-      licensed material, or material used under an exception or      limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors: 	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors       Considerations for the public: By using one of our public      licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the      licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If      the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for      example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to      copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our      licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain      other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of      the licensed material may still be restricted for other      reasons, including because others have copyright or other      rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,      such as asking that all changes be marked or described.      Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to      respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations      for the public:  	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensees  =======================================================================  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License  By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License ('Public License'). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.   Section 1 -- Definitions.    a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar      Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material      and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,      arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring      permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the      Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed      Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,      Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is      synched in timed relation with a moving image.    b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright      and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in      accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.    c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights      closely related to copyright including, without limitation,      performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database      Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or      categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights      specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar      Rights.    d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the      absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws      fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright      Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international      agreements.    e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or      any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights      that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.    f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,      or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public      License.    g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the      terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to      all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the      Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.    h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights      under this Public License.    i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or      process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such      as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,      dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material      available to the public including in ways that members of the      public may access the material from a place and at a time      individually chosen by them.    j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright      resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of      the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,      as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially      equivalent rights anywhere in the world.    k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights      under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.   Section 2 -- Scope.    a. License grant.         1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,           the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,           non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to           exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:              a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or                in part; and              b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.         2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where           Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public           License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with           its terms and conditions.         3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section           6(a).         4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The           Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in           all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,           and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The           Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or           authority to forbid You from making technical modifications           necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including           technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective           Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,           simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)           (4) never produces Adapted Material.         5. Downstream recipients.              a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every                recipient of the Licensed Material automatically                receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the                Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this                Public License.              b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose                any additional or different terms or conditions on, or                apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the                Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the                Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed                Material.         6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or           may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You           are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected           with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,           the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as           provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).    b. Other rights.         1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not           licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,           privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to           the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to           assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited           extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed           Rights, but not otherwise.         2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this           Public License.         3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to           collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed           Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society           under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory           licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly           reserves any right to collect such royalties.   Section 3 -- License Conditions.  Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.    a. Attribution.         1.

If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the           information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent           reasonably practicable.         4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's           License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted           Material from complying with this Public License.   Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.  Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:    a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right      to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial      portion of the contents of the database;    b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database      contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database      Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database      Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and    c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share      all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.   Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.    a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE      EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS      AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF      ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,      IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER.

The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided      above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent      possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and      waiver of all liability.   Section 6 -- Term and Termination.    a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and      Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with      this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License      terminate automatically.    b.

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/chokidar.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chokidar)  ## Why? Node.js `fs.watch`:  * Doesn't report filenames on MacOS. * Doesn't report events at all when using editors like Sublime on MacOS. * Often reports events twice. * Emits most changes as `rename`. * Has [a lot of other issues](https://github.com/nodejs/node/search?q=fs.watch&type=Issues) * Does not provide an easy way to recursively watch file trees.  Node.js `fs.watchFile`:  * Almost as bad at event handling. * Also does not provide any recursive watching. * Results in high CPU utilization.  Chokidar resolves these problems.  Initially made for **[Brunch](http://brunch.io)** (an ultra-swift web app build tool), it is now used in [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/), [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io), [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/PM2), [browserify](http://browserify.org/), [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/), [Microsoft's Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode), and [many others](https://www.npmjs.org/browse/depended/chokidar/). It has proven itself in production environments.  ## How? Chokidar does still rely on the Node.js core `fs` module, but when using `fs.watch` and `fs.watchFile` for watching, it normalizes the events it receives, often checking for truth by getting file stats and/or dir contents.  On MacOS, chokidar by default uses a native extension exposing the Darwin `FSEvents` API. This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with implementations like `kqueue` available on most \*nix platforms. Chokidar still does have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.  On other platforms, the `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which avoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate watchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been specified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much more than needed.  ## Getting started Install with npm:  ```sh npm install chokidar ```  Then `require` and use it in your code:  ```javascript var chokidar = require('chokidar');  // One-liner for current directory, ignores .dotfiles chokidar.watch('.', {ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../}).on('all', (event, path) => {   console.log(event, path); }); ```  ```javascript // Example of a more typical implementation structure:  // Initialize watcher. var watcher = chokidar.watch('file, dir, glob, or array', {   ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../,   persistent: true });  // Something to use when events are received. var log = console.log.bind(console); // Add event listeners. watcher   .on('add', path => log(`File ${path} has been added`))   .on('change', path => log(`File ${path} has been changed`))   .on('unlink', path => log(`File ${path} has been removed`));  // More possible events. watcher   .on('addDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been added`))   .on('unlinkDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been removed`))   .on('error', error => log(`Watcher error: ${error}`))   .on('ready', () => log('Initial scan complete. Ready for changes'))   .on('raw', (event, path, details) => {     log('Raw event info:', event, path, details);   });  // 'add', 'addDir' and 'change' events also receive stat() results as second // argument when available: http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats watcher.on('change', (path, stats) => {   if (stats) console.log(`File ${path} changed size to ${stats.size}`); });  // Watch new files. watcher.add('new-file'); watcher.add(['new-file-2', 'new-file-3', '**/other-file*']);  // Get list of actual paths being watched on the filesystem var watchedPaths = watcher.getWatched();  // Un-watch some files. watcher.unwatch('new-file*');  // Stop watching. watcher.close();  // Full list of options. See below for descriptions. (do not use this example) chokidar.watch('file', {   persistent: true,    ignored: '*.txt',   ignoreInitial: false,   followSymlinks: true,   cwd: '.',   disableGlobbing: false,    usePolling: true,   interval: 100,   binaryInterval: 300,   alwaysStat: false,   depth: 99,   awaitWriteFinish: {     stabilityThreshold: 2000,     pollInterval: 100   },    ignorePermissionErrors: false,   atomic: true // or a custom 'atomicity delay', in milliseconds (default 100) });  ```  ## API  `chokidar.watch(paths, [options])`  * `paths` (string or array of strings). Paths to files, dirs to be watched recursively, or glob patterns. * `options` (object) Options object as defined below:  #### Persistence  * `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process should continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to `false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted after `ready`, even if the process continues to run.  #### Path filtering  * `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition) Defines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is tested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it gets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second time with two arguments (the path and the [`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats) object of that path). * `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while instantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the `ready` event). * `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the symlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following the link references and bubbling events through the link's path. * `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be derived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this. * `disableGlobbing` (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()` and `.add()` are treated as literal path names, even if they look like globs.  #### Performance  * `usePolling` (default: `false`). Whether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling leads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is typically necessary to **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over a network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other non-standard situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on MacOS overrides the `useFsEvents` default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable to true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option. * _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when `usePolling: true`)   * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling. You may also     set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.   * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system   polling for binary files.   ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json)) * `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on MacOS). Whether to use the `fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly and `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When set to `false` on MacOS, `usePolling: true` becomes the default. * `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the [`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats) object that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set this to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn't already available from the underlying watch events. * `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of subdirectories will be traversed. * `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`). By default, the `add` event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before the entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some `change` events will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases, especially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the write operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification. Setting `awaitWriteFinish` to `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size, holding its `add` and `change` events until the size does not change for a configurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily dependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should be relatively high, making file watching much less responsive. Use with caution.   * *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust   timing params:*   * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000). Amount of time in   milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.   * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval.  #### Errors * `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates whether to watch files that don't have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM` or `EACCES` with this set to `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently. * `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`). Automatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use 'atomic writes' instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is re-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event rather than `unlink` then `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well for you, you can override it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in milliseconds.  ### Methods & Events  `chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:  * `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking. Takes an array of strings or just one string. * `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event. Available events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`, `raw`, `error`. Additionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event name and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`. * `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns. Takes an array of strings or just one string. * `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files. * `.getWatched()`: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file system being watched by this `FSWatcher` instance. The object's keys are all the directories (using absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the values are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.  ## CLI  If you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out [chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you to execute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.  ## Install Troubleshooting  * `npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n`   * This message is normal part of how `npm` handles optional dependencies and is     not indicative of a problem. Even if accompanied by other related error messages,     Chokidar should function properly.  * `ERR! stack Error: Python executable 'python' is v3.4.1, which is not supported by gyp.`   * You should be able to resolve this by installing python 2.7 and running:     `npm config set python python2.7`  * `gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make`   * On Mac, install the XCode command-line tools  ## License  The MIT License (MIT)  Copyright (c) 2012-2019 Paul Miller (https://paulmillr.com) & Elan Shanker  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

"css-blank-pseudo@0.1.4","https://github.com/csstools/css-blank-pseudo","CC0-1.0","","# CC0 1.0 Universal  ## Statement of Purpose  The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an “owner”) of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a “Work”).  Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works (“Commons”) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.  For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.  1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be    protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and    Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited    to, the following:    1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,       and translate a Work;    2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);    3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness       depicted in a Work;    4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,       subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;    5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in       a Work;    6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the       European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal       protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,       including any amended or successor version of such directive); and    7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world       based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations       thereof.  2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,    applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and    unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright    and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now    known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of    action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum    duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time    extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of    copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation    commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer    makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and    to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that    such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,    termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet    enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express    Statement of Purpose.  3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be    judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver    shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account    Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the    Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a    royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,    irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and    Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the    maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time    extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of    copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation    commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License    shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the    Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally    invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or    ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in    such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any    of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)    assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,    in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.  4. Limitations and Disclaimers.    1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,       surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.    2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties       of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or       otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,       merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or       the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or       absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest       extent permissible under applicable law.    3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons       that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without       limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.       Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary       consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.    4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a       party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this       CC0 or use of the Work.

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works (“Commons”) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.  For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.  1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be    protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and    Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited    to, the following:    1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,       and translate a Work;    2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);    3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness       depicted in a Work;    4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,       subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;    5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in       a Work;    6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the       European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal       protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,       including any amended or successor version of such directive); and    7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world       based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations       thereof.  2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,    applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and    unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright    and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now    known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of    action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum    duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time    extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of    copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation    commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer    makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and    to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that    such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,    termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet    enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express    Statement of Purpose.  3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be    judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver    shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account    Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the    Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a    royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,    irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and    Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the    maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time    extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of    copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation    commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License    shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the    Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally    invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or    ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in    such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any    of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)    assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,    in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.  4. Limitations and Disclaimers.    1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,       surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.    2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties       of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or       otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,       merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or       the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or       absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest       extent permissible under applicable law.    3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons       that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without       limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.       Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary       consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.    4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a       party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this       CC0 or use of the Work.

NOTE: Please take a look at http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/ before choosing a curve for your cryptography operations.  ## Incentive  ECC is much slower than regular RSA cryptography, the JS implementations are even more slower.  ## Benchmarks  ```bash $ node benchmarks/index.js Benchmarking: sign elliptic#sign x 262 ops/sec ±0.51% (177 runs sampled) eccjs#sign x 55.91 ops/sec ±0.90% (144 runs sampled) ------------------------ Fastest is elliptic#sign ======================== Benchmarking: verify elliptic#verify x 113 ops/sec ±0.50% (166 runs sampled) eccjs#verify x 48.56 ops/sec ±0.36% (125 runs sampled) ------------------------ Fastest is elliptic#verify ======================== Benchmarking: gen elliptic#gen x 294 ops/sec ±0.43% (176 runs sampled) eccjs#gen x 62.25 ops/sec ±0.63% (129 runs sampled) ------------------------ Fastest is elliptic#gen ======================== Benchmarking: ecdh elliptic#ecdh x 136 ops/sec ±0.85% (156 runs sampled) ------------------------ Fastest is elliptic#ecdh ======================== ```  ## API  ### ECDSA  ```javascript var EC = require('elliptic').ec;  // Create and initialize EC context // (better do it once and reuse it) var ec = new EC('secp256k1');  // Generate keys var key = ec.genKeyPair();  // Sign the message's hash (input must be an array, or a hex-string) var msgHash = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ]; var signature = key.sign(msgHash);  // Export DER encoded signature in Array var derSign = signature.toDER();  // Verify signature console.log(key.verify(msgHash, derSign));  // CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY  var pubPoint = key.getPublic(); var x = pubPoint.getX(); var y = pubPoint.getY();  // Public Key MUST be either: // 1) '04' + hex string of x + hex string of y; or // 2) object with two hex string properties (x and y); or // 3) object with two buffer properties (x and y) var pub = pubPoint.encode('hex');                                 // case 1 var pub = { x: x.toString('hex'), y: y.toString('hex') };         // case 2 var pub = { x: x.toBuffer(), y: y.toBuffer() };                   // case 3 var pub = { x: x.toArrayLike(Buffer), y: y.toArrayLike(Buffer) }; // case 3  // Import public key var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');  // Signature MUST be either: // 1) DER-encoded signature as hex-string; or // 2) DER-encoded signature as buffer; or // 3) object with two hex-string properties (r and s); or // 4) object with two buffer properties (r and s)  var signature = '3046022100...'; // case 1 var signature = new Buffer('...'); // case 2 var signature = { r: 'b1fc...', s: '9c42...' }; // case 3  // Verify signature console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature)); ```  ### EdDSA  ```javascript var EdDSA = require('elliptic').eddsa;  // Create and initialize EdDSA context // (better do it once and reuse it) var ec = new EdDSA('ed25519');  // Create key pair from secret var key = ec.keyFromSecret('693e3c...'); // hex string, array or Buffer  // Sign the message's hash (input must be an array, or a hex-string) var msgHash = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ]; var signature = key.sign(msgHash).toHex();  // Verify signature console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));  // CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY  // Import public key var pub = '0a1af638...'; var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');  // Verify signature var signature = '70bed1...'; console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature)); ```  ### ECDH  ```javascript var EC = require('elliptic').ec; var ec = new EC('curve25519');  // Generate keys var key1 = ec.genKeyPair(); var key2 = ec.genKeyPair();  var shared1 = key1.derive(key2.getPublic()); var shared2 = key2.derive(key1.getPublic());  console.log('Both shared secrets are BN instances'); console.log(shared1.toString(16)); console.log(shared2.toString(16)); ```  three and more members: ```javascript var EC = require('elliptic').ec; var ec = new EC('curve25519');  var A = ec.genKeyPair(); var B = ec.genKeyPair(); var C = ec.genKeyPair();  var AB = A.getPublic().mul(B.getPrivate()) var BC = B.getPublic().mul(C.getPrivate()) var CA = C.getPublic().mul(A.getPrivate())  var ABC = AB.mul(C.getPrivate()) var BCA = BC.mul(A.getPrivate()) var CAB = CA.mul(B.getPrivate())  console.log(ABC.getX().toString(16)) console.log(BCA.getX().toString(16)) console.log(CAB.getX().toString(16)) ```  NOTE: `.derive()` returns a [BN][1] instance.  ## Supported curves  Elliptic.js support following curve types:  * Short Weierstrass * Montgomery * Edwards * Twisted Edwards  Following curve 'presets' are embedded into the library:  * `secp256k1` * `p192` * `p224` * `p256` * `p384` * `p521` * `curve25519` * `ed25519`  NOTE: That `curve25519` could not be used for ECDSA, use `ed25519` instead.  ### Implementation details  ECDSA is using deterministic `k` value generation as per [RFC6979][0]. Most of the curve operations are performed on non-affine coordinates (either projective or extended), various windowing techniques are used for different cases.  All operations are performed in reduction context using [bn.js][1], hashing is provided by [hash.js][2]  ### Related projects  * [eccrypto][3]: isomorphic implementation of ECDSA, ECDH and ECIES for both   browserify and node (uses `elliptic` for browser and [secp256k1-node][4] for   node)  #### LICENSE  This software is licensed under the MIT License.

"errno@0.1.7","https://github.com/rvagg/node-errno","MIT","","# node-errno  > Better [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv)/[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)/[io.js](https://iojs.org) error handling & reporting. Available in npm as *errno*.  [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/errno.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/errno) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rvagg/node-errno.png)](http://travis-ci.org/rvagg/node-errno) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/errno.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/errno)  * [errno exposed](#errnoexposed) * [Custom errors](#customerrors)  <a name='errnoexposed'></a> ## errno exposed  Ever find yourself needing more details about Node.js errors? Me too, so *node-errno* contains the errno mappings direct from libuv so you can use them in your code.  **By errno:**  ```js require('errno').errno[3] // → { //     'errno': 3, //     'code': 'EACCES', //     'description': 'permission denied' //   } ```  **By code:**  ```js require('errno').code.ENOTEMPTY // → { //     'errno': 53, //     'code': 'ENOTEMPTY', //     'description': 'directory not empty' //   } ```  **Make your errors more descriptive:**  ```js var errno = require('errno')  function errmsg(err) {   var str = 'Error: '   // if it's a libuv error then get the description from errno   if (errno.errno[err.errno])     str += errno.errno[err.errno].description   else     str += err.message    // if it's a `fs` error then it'll have a 'path' property   if (err.path)     str += ' [' + err.path + ']'    return str }  var fs = require('fs')  fs.readFile('thisisnotarealfile.txt', function (err, data) {   if (err)     console.log(errmsg(err)) }) ```  **Use as a command line tool:**  ``` ~ $ errno 53 {   'errno': 53,   'code': 'ENOTEMPTY',   'description': 'directory not empty' } ~ $ errno EROFS {   'errno': 56,   'code': 'EROFS',   'description': 'read-only file system' } ~ $ errno foo No such errno/code: 'foo' ```  Supply no arguments for the full list. Error codes are processed case-insensitive.  You will need to install with `npm install errno -g` if you want the `errno` command to be available without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.  <a name='customerrors'></a> ## Custom errors  Use `errno.custom.createError()` to create custom `Error` objects to throw around in your Node.js library. Create error hierarchies so `instanceof` becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a `cause` property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.  ```js var create = require('errno').custom.createError var MyError = create('MyError') // inherits from Error var SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError) // inherits from MyError var OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)  // use them! if (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad happened')  if (err) return callback(new OtherError(err)) ```  Also available is a `errno.custom.FilesystemError` with in-built access to errno properties:  ```js fs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {   if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))   // do something else }) ```  The resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: `code`, `errno`, `path` and `message` will contain a descriptive human-readable message.  ## Contributors  * [bahamas10](https://github.com/bahamas10) (Dave Eddy) - Added CLI * [ralphtheninja](https://github.com/ralphtheninja) (Lars-Magnus Skog)  ## Copyright & Licence  *Copyright (c) 2012-2015 [Rod Vagg](https://github.com/rvagg) ([@rvagg](https://twitter.com/rvagg))*  Made available under the MIT licence:  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

"esrecurse@4.3.0","https://github.com/estools/esrecurse","BSD-2-Clause","Copyright (C) 2014 [Yusuke Suzuki](https://github.com/Constellation).  (twitter: [@Constellation](https://twitter.com/Constellation)) and other contributors.","### Esrecurse [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse)  Esrecurse ([esrecurse](https://github.com/estools/esrecurse)) is [ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm) recursive traversing functionality.  ### Example Usage  The following code will output all variables declared at the root of a file.  ```javascript esrecurse.visit(ast, {     XXXStatement: function (node) {         this.visit(node.left);         // do something...         this.visit(node.right);     } }); ```  We can use `Visitor` instance.  ```javascript var visitor = new esrecurse.Visitor({     XXXStatement: function (node) {         this.visit(node.left);         // do something...         this.visit(node.right);     } });  visitor.visit(ast); ```  We can inherit `Visitor` instance easily.  ```javascript class Derived extends esrecurse.Visitor {     constructor()     {         super(null);     }      XXXStatement(node) {     } } ```  ```javascript function DerivedVisitor() {     esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */); } util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor); DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {     this.visit(node.left);     // do something...     this.visit(node.right); }; ```  And you can invoke default visiting operation inside custom visit operation.  ```javascript function DerivedVisitor() {     esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */); } util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor); DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {     // do something...     this.visitChildren(node); }; ```  The `childVisitorKeys` option does customize the behaviour of `this.visitChildren(node)`. We can use user-defined node types.  ```javascript // This tree contains a user-defined `TestExpression` node. var tree = {     type: 'TestExpression',      // This 'argument' is the property containing the other **node**.     argument: {         type: 'Literal',         value: 20     },      // This 'extended' is the property not containing the other **node**.     extended: true }; esrecurse.visit(     ast,     {         Literal: function (node) {             // do something...         }     },     {         // Extending the existing traversing rules.         childVisitorKeys: {             // TargetNodeName: [ 'keys', 'containing', 'the', 'other', '**node**' ]             TestExpression: ['argument']         }     } ); ```  We can use the `fallback` option as well. If the `fallback` option is `'iteration'`, `esrecurse` would visit all enumerable properties of unknown nodes. Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).  ```javascript esrecurse.visit(     ast,     {         Literal: function (node) {             // do something...         }     },     {         fallback: 'iteration'     } ); ```  If the `fallback` option is a function, `esrecurse` calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes. Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).  ```javascript esrecurse.visit(     ast,     {         Literal: function (node) {             // do something...         }     },     {         fallback: function (node) {             return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key) {                 return key !== 'argument'             });         }     } ); ```  ### License  Copyright (C) 2014 [Yusuke Suzuki](https://github.com/Constellation)  (twitter: [@Constellation](https://twitter.com/Constellation)) and other contributors.

"estree-walker@0.6.1","https://github.com/Rich-Harris/estree-walker","MIT","","# estree-walker  Simple utility for walking an [ESTree](https://github.com/estree/estree)-compliant AST, such as one generated by [acorn](https://github.com/marijnh/acorn).   ## Installation  ```bash npm i estree-walker ```   ## Usage  ```js var walk = require( 'estree-walker' ).walk; var acorn = require( 'acorn' );  ast = acorn.parse( sourceCode, options ); // https://github.com/acornjs/acorn  walk( ast, {   enter: function ( node, parent, prop, index ) {     // some code happens   },   leave: function ( node, parent, prop, index ) {   	// some code happens   } }); ```  Inside the `enter` function, calling `this.skip()` will prevent the node's children being walked, or the `leave` function (which is optional) being called.   ## Why not use estraverse?  The ESTree spec is evolving to accommodate ES6/7. I've had a couple of experiences where [estraverse](https://github.com/estools/estraverse) was unable to handle an AST generated by recent versions of acorn, because it hard-codes visitor keys.  estree-walker, by contrast, simply enumerates a node's properties to find child nodes (and child lists of nodes), and is therefore resistant to spec changes. It's also much smaller. (The performance, if you're wondering, is basically identical.)

"faye-websocket@0.10.0","https://github.com/faye/faye-websocket-node","MIT","Copyright (c) 2010-2015 James Coglan","# faye-websocket  * Travis CI build: [![Build   status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/faye/faye-websocket-node.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/faye/faye-websocket-node) * Autobahn tests: [server](http://faye.jcoglan.com/autobahn/servers/),   [client](http://faye.jcoglan.com/autobahn/clients/)  This is a general-purpose WebSocket implementation extracted from the [Faye](http://faye.jcoglan.com) project. It provides classes for easily building WebSocket servers and clients in Node. It does not provide a server itself, but rather makes it easy to handle WebSocket connections within an existing [Node](http://nodejs.org/) application. It does not provide any abstraction other than the standard [WebSocket API](http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/).  It also provides an abstraction for handling [EventSource](http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/) connections, which are one-way connections that allow the server to push data to the client. They are based on streaming HTTP responses and can be easier to access via proxies than WebSockets.   ## Installation  ``` $ npm install faye-websocket ```   ## Handling WebSocket connections in Node  You can handle WebSockets on the server side by listening for HTTP Upgrade requests, and creating a new socket for the request. This socket object exposes the usual WebSocket methods for receiving and sending messages. For example this is how you'd implement an echo server:  ```js var WebSocket = require('faye-websocket'),     http      = require('http');  var server = http.createServer();  server.on('upgrade', function(request, socket, body) {   if (WebSocket.isWebSocket(request)) {     var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body);          ws.on('message', function(event) {       ws.send(event.data);     });          ws.on('close', function(event) {       console.log('close', event.code, event.reason);       ws = null;     });   } });  server.listen(8000); ```  `WebSocket` objects are also duplex streams, so you could replace the `ws.on('message', ...)` line with:  ```js     ws.pipe(ws); ```  Note that under certain circumstances (notably a draft-76 client connecting through an HTTP proxy), the WebSocket handshake will not be complete after you call `new WebSocket()` because the server will not have received the entire handshake from the client yet. In this case, calls to `ws.send()` will buffer the message in memory until the handshake is complete, at which point any buffered messages will be sent to the client.  If you need to detect when the WebSocket handshake is complete, you can use the `onopen` event.  If the connection's protocol version supports it, you can call `ws.ping()` to send a ping message and wait for the client's response. This method takes a message string, and an optional callback that fires when a matching pong message is received. It returns `true` if and only if a ping message was sent. If the client does not support ping/pong, this method sends no data and returns `false`.  ```js ws.ping('Mic check, one, two', function() {   // fires when pong is received }); ```   ## Using the WebSocket client  The client supports both the plain-text `ws` protocol and the encrypted `wss` protocol, and has exactly the same interface as a socket you would use in a web browser. On the wire it identifies itself as `hybi-13`.  ```js var WebSocket = require('faye-websocket'),     ws        = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/');  ws.on('open', function(event) {   console.log('open');   ws.send('Hello, world!'); });  ws.on('message', function(event) {   console.log('message', event.data); });  ws.on('close', function(event) {   console.log('close', event.code, event.reason);   ws = null; }); ```  The WebSocket client also lets you inspect the status and headers of the handshake response via its `statusCode` and `headers` properties.  To connect via a proxy, set the `proxy` option to the HTTP origin of the proxy, including any authorization information, custom headers and TLS config you require. Only the `origin` setting is required.  ```js var ws = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/', [], {   proxy: {     origin:  'http://username:password@proxy.example.com',     headers: {'User-Agent': 'node'},     tls:     {cert: fs.readFileSync('client.crt')}   } }); ```  The `tls` value is a Node 'TLS options' object that will be passed to [`tls.connect()`](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback).   ## Subprotocol negotiation  The WebSocket protocol allows peers to select and identify the application protocol to use over the connection. On the client side, you can set which protocols the client accepts by passing a list of protocol names when you construct the socket:  ```js var ws = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/', ['irc', 'amqp']); ```  On the server side, you can likewise pass in the list of protocols the server supports after the other constructor arguments:  ```js var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, ['irc', 'amqp']); ```  If the client and server agree on a protocol, both the client- and server-side socket objects expose the selected protocol through the `ws.protocol` property.   ## Protocol extensions  faye-websocket is based on the [websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node) framework that allows extensions to be negotiated via the `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header. To add extensions to a connection, pass an array of extensions to the `:extensions` option. For example, to add [permessage-deflate](https://github.com/faye/permessage-deflate-node):  ```js var deflate = require('permessage-deflate');  var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, [], {extensions: [deflate]}); ```   ## Initialization options  Both the server- and client-side classes allow an options object to be passed in at initialization time, for example:  ```js var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, protocols, options); var ws = new WebSocket.Client(url, protocols, options); ```  `protocols` is an array of subprotocols as described above, or `null`. `options` is an optional object containing any of these fields:  * `extensions` - an array of   [websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node)   compatible extensions, as described above * `headers` - an object containing key-value pairs representing HTTP headers to   be sent during the handshake process * `maxLength` - the maximum allowed size of incoming message frames, in bytes.   The default value is `2^26 - 1`, or 1 byte short of 64 MiB. * `ping` - an integer that sets how often the WebSocket should send ping frames,   measured in seconds  The client accepts some additional options:  * `proxy` - settings for a proxy as described above * `tls` - a Node 'TLS options' object containing TLS settings for the origin   server, this will be passed to   [`tls.connect()`](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback) * `ca` - (legacy) a shorthand for passing `{tls: {ca: value}}`   ## WebSocket API  Both server- and client-side `WebSocket` objects support the following API.  * <b>`on('open', function(event) {})`</b> fires when the socket connection is   established. Event has no attributes. * <b>`on('message', function(event) {})`</b> fires when the socket receives a   message. Event has one attribute, <b>`data`</b>, which is either a `String`   (for text frames) or a `Buffer` (for binary frames). * <b>`on('error', function(event) {})`</b> fires when there is a protocol error   due to bad data sent by the other peer. This event is purely informational,   you do not need to implement error recover. * <b>`on('close', function(event) {})`</b> fires when either the client or the   server closes the connection. Event has two optional attributes, <b>`code`</b>   and <b>`reason`</b>, that expose the status code and message sent by the peer   that closed the connection. * <b>`send(message)`</b> accepts either a `String` or a `Buffer` and sends a   text or binary message over the connection to the other peer. * <b>`ping(message, function() {})`</b> sends a ping frame with an optional   message and fires the callback when a matching pong is received. * <b>`close(code, reason)`</b> closes the connection, sending the given status   code and reason text, both of which are optional. * <b>`version`</b> is a string containing the version of the `WebSocket`   protocol the connection is using. * <b>`protocol`</b> is a string (which may be empty) identifying the subprotocol   the socket is using.   ## Handling EventSource connections in Node  EventSource connections provide a very similar interface, although because they only allow the server to send data to the client, there is no `onmessage` API. EventSource allows the server to push text messages to the client, where each message has an optional event-type and ID.  ```js var WebSocket   = require('faye-websocket'),     EventSource = WebSocket.EventSource,     http        = require('http');  var server = http.createServer();  server.on('request', function(request, response) {   if (EventSource.isEventSource(request)) {     var es = new EventSource(request, response);     console.log('open', es.url, es.lastEventId);          // Periodically send messages     var loop = setInterval(function() { es.send('Hello') }, 1000);          es.on('close', function() {       clearInterval(loop);       es = null;     });      } else {     // Normal HTTP request     response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});     response.end('Hello');   } });  server.listen(8000); ```  The `send` method takes two optional parameters, `event` and `id`. The default event-type is `'message'` with no ID. For example, to send a `notification` event with ID `99`:  ```js es.send('Breaking News!', {event: 'notification', id: '99'}); ```  The `EventSource` object exposes the following properties:  * <b>`url`</b> is a string containing the URL the client used to create the   EventSource. * <b>`lastEventId`</b> is a string containing the last event ID received by the   client. You can use this when the client reconnects after a dropped connection   to determine which messages need resending.  When you initialize an EventSource with ` new EventSource()`, you can pass configuration options after the `response` parameter. Available options are:  * <b>`headers`</b> is an object containing custom headers to be set on the   EventSource response. * <b>`retry`</b> is a number that tells the client how long (in seconds) it   should wait after a dropped connection before attempting to reconnect. * <b>`ping`</b> is a number that tells the server how often (in seconds) to send   'ping' packets to the client to keep the connection open, to defeat timeouts   set by proxies. The client will ignore these messages.  For example, this creates a connection that allows access from any origin, pings every 15 seconds and is retryable every 10 seconds if the connection is broken:  ```js var es = new EventSource(request, response, {   headers: {'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'},   ping:    15,   retry:   10 }); ```  You can send a ping message at any time by calling `es.ping()`. Unlike WebSocket, the client does not send a response to this; it is merely to send some data over the wire to keep the connection alive.   ## License  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2010-2015 James Coglan  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

"fb-watchman@2.0.1","https://github.com/facebook/watchman","Apache-2.0","","# fb-watchman  `fb-watchman` is a filesystem watcher that uses the [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) file watching service from Facebook.  Watchman provides file change notification services using very efficient recursive watches and also allows more advanced change matching and filesystem tree querying operations using [a powerful expression syntax](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/file-query.html#expressions).  ## Install  You should [install Watchman]( https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html) to make the most of this module.  Then simply:  ``` $ npm install fb-watchman ```  ## Key Concepts  - Watchman recursively watches directories. - Each watched directory is called a `root`. - You must initiate a `watch` on a `root` using the `watch-project` command prior to subscribing to changes - Rather than separately watching many sibling directories, `watch-project` consolidates and re-uses existing watches relative to a project root (the location of your `.watchmanconfig` or source control repository root) - change notifications are relative to the project root  ## How do I use it?  [Read the NodeJS watchman documentation](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/nodejs.html)"

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:  You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and  You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and  You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and  If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

"growly@1.3.0","https://github.com/theabraham/growly","MIT","Copyright (C) 2014 Ibrahim Al-Rajhi <abrahamalrajhi@gmail.com>","# Growly #  Simple zero-dependency Growl notifications using GNTP.  ## Installation ##  Install growly using `npm`:  ``` npm install growly ```  And then require it:  ```javascript var growly = require('growly'); ```  This module uses the Growl Network Transport Protocol (GNTP) which was implemented in Growl since version 1.3, so you **must have an appropriate version of Growl installed** for Growly to work.  ## Example ##  Sending a minimal Growl notification:  ```javascript var growly = require('growly');  growly.notify('This is as easy as it gets', { title: 'Hello, World!' }); ```  More examples can be found in the *example/* directory.  ## Usage ##  The growly module exposes only three methods: `Growly.register()`, `Growly.notify()`, and `Growly.setHost()`.  ### Growly.register(appname, [appicon], [notifications], [callback]) ###  Registers a new application with Growl. Registration is completely optional since it will be performed automatically for you with sensible defaults. Useful if you want your application, with its own icon and types of notifications, to show up in Growl's prefence panel.    - `appname` the name of the application (required.)   - `appicon` url, file path, or Buffer instance for an application icon image.   - `notifications` a list of defined notification types with the following properties:     - `.label` name used to identify the type of notification being used (required.)     - `.dispname` name users will see in Growl's preference panel (defaults to `.label`.)     - `.enabled` whether or not notifications of this type are enabled (defaults to true.)   - `callback` called when the registration completes; if registration fails, the first argument will be an Error object.  An example:  ```javascript growly.register('My Application', 'path/to/icon.png', [     { label: 'success', dispname: 'Success' },     { label: 'warning', dispname: 'Warning', enabled: false } ], function(err) {     console.log(err || 'Registration successful!'); }); ```  ### Growly.notify(text, [opts], [callback]) ###  Sends a Growl notification. If an application wasn't registered beforehand with `growly.register()`, a default application will automatically be registered beforesending the notification.    - `text` the body of the notification.   - `opts` an object with the following properties:     - `.title` title of the notification.     - `.icon` url, file path, or Buffer instance for the notification's icon.     - `.sticky` whether or not to sticky the notification (defaults to false.)     - `.label` type of notification to use (defaults to the first registered notification type.)     - `.priority` the priority of the notification from lowest (-2) to highest (2).     - `.coalescingId` replace/update the matching previous notification. May be ignored.   - `callback` called when the user has closed/clicked the notification. The callback is passed an Error object `err` as the first argument when the notification fails; otherwise, the second argument `action` is a string that'll describe which action has been taken by the user (either 'closed' or 'clicked'.)  An example:  ```javascript /* Assuming an application was registered with a notification type labeled 'warning'. */ growly.notify('Stuffs broken!', { label: 'warning' }, function(err, action) {     console.log('Action:', action); }); ```  ### Growly.setHost(host, port) ###  Set the host and port that Growl (GNTP) requests will be sent to. Using this method is optional since GNTP defaults to using host 'localhost' and port 23053.  ## License ##  Copyright (C) 2014 Ibrahim Al-Rajhi <abrahamalrajhi@gmail.com>  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

"harmony-reflect@1.6.1","git+https://tvcutsem@github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect","(Apache-2.0 OR MPL-1.1)","","[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/harmony-reflect.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/harmony-reflect) [![Dependencies](https://david-dm.org/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect.png)](https://david-dm.org/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect)  This is a shim for the ECMAScript 6 [Reflect](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-reflect-object) and [Proxy](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-proxy-objects) objects.  This library does two things:    - It defines an ES6-compliant `Reflect` global object that exports the ECMAScript 6 reflection API.   - If harmony-era (pre-ES6) `Proxy` support is available, it patches `Proxy` to be up-to-date with the [ES6 spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/).  **July 2016 update**: the most recent version of all major browsers and node.js now [support fully ES6-compliant](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/#test-Proxy) `Reflect` and `Proxy` objects. This shim is primarily useful if you want ES6 `Reflect` support on older browsers or versions of node.js < v6.0.0, or if you want ES6 `Proxy` support on versions of node.js < v6.0.0.  **May 2016 update**: the recently released [V8 v4.9](http://v8project.blogspot.com.au/2016/01/v8-release-49.html) includes native support for ES2015 Proxies and Reflect, making this library obsolete for environments that embed V8 4.9 or newer (like Chrome 49 and Node v6.0). Node v5.10.x or lower still requires this polyfill for proper ES6 Proxy support.  Read [Why should I use this library?](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/wiki)  Installation ============  For node.js, install via [npm](http://npmjs.org):      npm install harmony-reflect  Then:      node --harmony-proxies     > var Reflect = require('harmony-reflect');  See [release notes](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/blob/master/RELNOTES.md) for changes to the npm releases.  To use in a browser, just download the single reflect.js file. After loading      <script src='reflect.js'></script>  a global object `Reflect` is defined that contains reflection methods as defined in the [ES6 spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-reflect-object).  This library also updates the 'harmony-era' `Proxy` object in the V8 engine (also used in node.js) to follow the latest [ECMAScript 2015](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) spec. To create such a proxy, call:      var proxy = new Proxy(target, handler);  See below for a list of spec incompatibilities and other gotcha's.  API Docs ========  This module exports an object named `Reflect` and updates the global `Proxy` object (if it exists) to be compatible with the latest ECMAScript 6 spec.  The ECMAScript 6 Proxy API allows one to intercept various operations on Javascript objects.    * Overview of all [supported traps](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/tree/master/doc/traps.md) on proxies   * The [Reflect API](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/tree/master/doc/api.md)    * The Proxy [Handler API](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/tree/master/doc/handler_api.md)    Compatibility =============  The `Reflect` API, with support for proxies, was tested on:    * Firefox (>= v4.0)   * `node --harmony_proxies` (>= v0.7.8)   * `iojs --harmony_proxies` (>= 2.3.0)   * `v8 --harmony_proxies` (>= v3.6)   * Any recent `js` spidermonkey shell  If you need only `Reflect` and not an up-to-date `Proxy` object, this library should work on any modern ES5 engine (including all browsers).  Compatibility notes:    * Chrome (>= v19 && <= v37) used to support proxies behind a flag     (`chrome://flags/#enable-javascript-harmony`) but Chrome v38  [removed](https://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=1543#c44) the `Proxy` constructor. As a result, this library cannot patch the harmony-era `Proxy` object on Chrome v38 or above. If you're working with Chromium directly, it's still possible to enable proxies using `chromium-browser --js-flags='--harmony_proxies'`.   * In older versions of V8, the `Proxy` constructor was enabled by     default when starting V8 with `--harmony`. For recent versions of V8,     `Proxy` must be explicitly enabled with `--harmony_proxies`.  Dependencies ============    *  ECMAScript 5/strict   *  To emulate direct proxies:     *  old Harmony [Proxies](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:proxies)     *  Harmony [WeakMaps](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:weak_maps)  After loading `reflect.js` into your page or other JS environment, be aware that the following globals are patched to be able to recognize emulated direct proxies:      Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor     Object.defineProperty     Object.defineProperties     Object.getOwnPropertyNames     Object.getOwnPropertySymbols     Object.keys     Object.{get,set}PrototypeOf     Object.assign     Object.{freeze,seal,preventExtensions}     Object.{isFrozen,isSealed,isExtensible}     Object.prototype.valueOf     Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf     Object.prototype.toString     Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty     Function.prototype.toString     Date.prototype.toString     Array.isArray     Array.prototype.concat     Proxy     Reflect  :warning: In node.js, when you `require('harmony-reflect')`, only the current module's globals are patched. If you pass an emulated direct proxy to an external module, and that module uses the unpatched globals, the module may not interact with the proxy according to the latest ES6 Proxy API, instead falling back on the old pre-ES6 Proxy API. This can cause bugs, e.g. the built-in `Array.isArray` will return `false` when passed a proxy-for-array, while the patched `Array.isArray` will return true. I know of no good fix to reliably patch the globals for all node modules. If you do, let me know.  Examples ========  The [examples](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/tree/master/examples) directory contains a number of examples demonstrating the use of proxies:    * membranes: wrappers that transitively isolate two object-graphs.   * observer: a self-hosted implementation of the ES7 `Object.observe` notification mechanism.   * profiler: a simple profiler to collect usage statistics of an object.  Other example uses of proxies (not done by me, but using this library):    * supporting [negative array indices](https://github.com/sindresorhus/negative-array) a la Python   * [tpyo](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/tpyo): using proxies to correct typo's in JS property names   * [persistent objects](http://tagtree.tv/es6-proxies): shows how one might go about using proxies to save updates to objects in a database incrementally   * [defaultdict](https://github.com/greenify/defaultdict2): default values for new keys in objects (as known from Python)  For more examples of proxies, and a good overview of their design rationale, I recommend reading [Axel Rauschmayer's blog post on proxies](http://www.2ality.com/2014/12/es6-proxies.html).  Proxy Handler API =================  The sister project [proxy-handlers](https://github.com/tvcutsem/proxy-handlers) defines a number of predefined Proxy handlers as 'abstract classes' that your  code can 'subclass' The goal is to minimize the number of traps that your proxy handlers must implement.  Spec Incompatibilities and other gotcha's =========================================  This library differs from the [ECMAScript 2016 spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/index.html) as follows:    * In ES7, the `enumerate()` trap, and the corresponding `Reflect.enumerate()` method, have been [removed](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/issues/161).     This shim still supports the trap.   * The ES7 (and ES6) spec contains a      [bug](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/666) that leads to missing     invariant checks in the getOwnPropertyDescriptor, defineProperty and deleteProperty traps. This library already contains the patch referred     to in [this issue](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/666).  This library differs from the [ECMAScript 2015 spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) as follows:    * In ES6, `Proxy` is a constructor function that _requires_ the use     of `new`. That is, you must write `new Proxy(target, handler)`. This library     exports `Proxy` as an ordinary function which may be called with or without using the `new` operator.        * In ES6, `Function.prototype.toString` and `Date.prototype.toString` do not     operate transparently on Proxies. This shim patches those functions so that     stringifying a Proxy-for-a-function or a Proxy-for-a-date 'unwraps' the     proxy and instead stringifies the target of the Proxy. This behavior may     change in the future to be more spec-compatible.        * This library does not shim [Symbol objects](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-symbol-objects).     On modern V8 or io.js which supports Symbol objects natively, due to a bug in V8, Symbols and Proxies     don't play well together. [Read more](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/issues/57).      * Proxies-for-arrays are serialized as JSON objects rather than as JSON arrays. That is, `JSON.stringify(new Proxy([], {}))` returns '{}' rather than '[]'. [Read more]( https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/issues/13#issuecomment-17249465)."

'Derivative Works' shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.        'Contribution' shall mean any work of authorship, including       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of       the copyright owner.

'Contributor' shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and       subsequently incorporated within the Work.     2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS     APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

"imurmurhash@0.1.4","https://github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js","MIT","","iMurmurHash.js ==============  An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).  This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.  Installation ------------  To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.  ```html <script type='text/javascript' src='/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js'></script> <script> // Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3 </script> ```  ---  To use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:  ```bash npm install imurmurhash ```  Then simply include it in your scripts:  ```javascript MurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash'); ```  Quick Example -------------  ```javascript // Create the initial hash var hashState = MurmurHash3('string');  // Incrementally add text hashState.hash('more strings'); hashState.hash('even more strings');  // All calls can be chained if desired hashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');  // Get a result hashState.result(); // returns 0xe4ccfe6b ```  Functions ---------  ### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed]) Get a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:  ```javascript // Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same // object (but reset, so the current state would be lost) hashState = MurmurHash3(); ...  // Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the // function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss // will occur, at the cost of creating more objects. hashState = new MurmurHash3(); ```  Both methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.  ---  ### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string) Incrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.  ---  ### MurmurHash3.prototype.result () Get the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.  ```javascript // Do the whole string at once MurmurHash3('this is a test string').result(); // 0x70529328  // Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part var m = MurmurHash3('this is a'); m.result(); // 0xbfc4f834 m.hash(' test string').result(); // 0x70529328 (same as above) ```  ---  ### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed]) Reset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.  ---  License (MIT) ------------- Copyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

The default resolver will already use PnP.  Simply add the resolver to your configuration. For example, a minimal `jest.config.js` would be as such:  ```js module.exports = {   resolver: require.resolve(`jest-pnp-resolver`) }; ```  ## License (MIT)  > **Copyright © 2016 Maël Nison** > > Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: > > The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. > > THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

"language-subtag-registry@0.3.21","https://github.com/mattcg/language-subtag-registry","ODC-By-1.0","","# ODC Attribution License (ODC-By)  ### Preamble  The Open Data Commons Attribution License is a license agreement intended to allow users to freely share, modify, and use this Database subject only to the attribution requirements set out in Section 4.  Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images, audiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example), and so this license only governs the rights over the Database, and not the contents of the Database individually. Licensors may therefore wish to use this license together with another license for the contents.  Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be covered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts, trademark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights over information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may have to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing activities not covered by this License.  ------  The Licensor (as defined below)   and   You (as defined below)   agree as follows:   ### 1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words  'Collective Database' - Means this Database in unmodified form as part of a collection of independent databases in themselves that together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Database will not be considered a Derivative Database.  'Convey' - As a verb, means Using the Database, a Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database in any way that enables a Person to make or receive copies of the Database or a Derivative Database.  Conveying does not include interaction with a user through a computer network, or creating and Using a Produced Work, where no transfer of a copy of the Database or a Derivative Database occurs.  'Contents' - The contents of this Database, which includes the information, independent works, or other material collected into the Database. For example, the contents of the Database could be factual data or works such as images, audiovisual material, text, or sounds.  'Database' - A collection of material (the Contents) arranged in a systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other means offered under the terms of this License.  'Database Directive' - Means Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended or succeeded.  'Database Right' - Means rights resulting from the Chapter III ('sui generis') rights in the Database Directive (as amended and as transposed by member states), which includes the Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, as well as any similar rights available in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4.   'Derivative Database' - Means a database based upon the Database, and includes any translation, adaptation, arrangement, modification, or any other alteration of the Database or of a Substantial part of the Contents. This includes, but is not limited to, Extracting or Re-utilising the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents in a new Database.  'Extraction' - Means the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a Substantial part of the Contents to another medium by any means or in any form.  'License' - Means this license agreement and is both a license of rights such as copyright and Database Rights and an agreement in contract.  'Licensor' - Means the Person that offers the Database under the terms of this License.   'Person' - Means a natural or legal person or a body of persons corporate or incorporate.  'Produced Work' -  a work (such as an image, audiovisual material, text, or sounds) resulting from using the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents (via a search or other query) from this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as part of a Collective Database.    'Publicly' - means to Persons other than You or under Your control by either more than 50% ownership or by the power to direct their activities (such as contracting with an independent consultant).   'Re-utilisation' - means any form of making available to the public all or a Substantial part of the Contents by the distribution of copies, by renting, by online or other forms of transmission.  'Substantial' - Means substantial in terms of quantity or quality or a combination of both. The repeated and systematic Extraction or Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may amount to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the Contents.  'Use' - As a verb, means doing any act that is restricted by copyright or Database Rights whether in the original medium or any other; and includes without limitation distributing, copying, publicly performing, publicly displaying, and preparing derivative works of the Database, as well as modifying the Database as may be technically necessary to use it in a different mode or format.   'You' - Means a Person exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Database, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.  Words in the singular include the plural and vice versa.  ### 2.0 What this License covers  2.1. Legal effect of this document. This License is:    a. A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights;    b. A license of the Database Right; and    c. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor.  2.2 Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal rights in the Database, including:    a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database.   The copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the   Database, but does not cover the copyright over the Contents   independent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright   law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database   model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation   of the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table   indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of   Contents stored in the Database;    b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and   Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents.   Database Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the   Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Contents are removed   from the Database and are selected and arranged in a way that would   not infringe any applicable copyright; and    c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for   access to the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of   use on this access as outlined in this License.   2.3 Rights not covered.     a. This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making   or operation of the Database;     b. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the   Database; and    c. This License does not cover any trademarks associated with the   Database.   2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of the Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights, including copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality rights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than Database Rights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database. For example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this License would not apply to copyright over individual images, which could have their own separate licenses, or one single license covering all of the rights over the images.    ### 3.0 Rights granted  3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but only under Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of any applicable copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly include commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the future.   The rights granted cover, for example:    a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of   the Contents;    b. Creation of Derivative Databases;    c. Creation of Collective Databases;    d. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and   in any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative   Databases or as a part of Collective Databases; and    e. Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or   performance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in   part, including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective   Databases.  3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt:    a. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in   which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or   compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves   the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You   of the rights granted under this License;    b. Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in   which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or   compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the   exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of   the rights granted under this License; and,    c. Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect   royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is   a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing   schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights   granted under this License.  3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop distributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that this Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice of using alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section 10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.  ### 4.0 Conditions of Use  4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to Your complying with the following conditions of use. These are important conditions of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be in material breach of its terms.  4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You must:     a. Do so only under the terms of this License;    b. Include a copy of this License or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)   with the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the   Database or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation;     c. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices   that refer to this License; and    d. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular   file due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a   location (such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to   look for it.  4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced Work does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you Publicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with the Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses, views, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced Work aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it is available under this License.    a. Example notice. The following text will satisfy notice under   Section 4.3:          Contains information from DATABASE NAME which is made available         under the ODC Attribution License.  DATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a hyperlink to the location of the Database. 'ODC Attribution License' should contain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If hyperlinks are not possible, You should include the plain text of the required URI's with the above notice.  4.4 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time You communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the Contents, or any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Database on the same terms and conditions as this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License, but You may enforce any rights that You have over a Derivative Database. You are solely responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database made by You or another Person at Your direction. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.  ### 5.0 Moral rights  5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights to be identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment that would otherwise prejudice the author's honour and reputation, or any other derogatory treatment:    a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives   all moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest   extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section   10.4;     b. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant   jurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral   rights over the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the   fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under   Section 10.4; and    c. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert   moral rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their   moral rights over certain aspects of the Database.  Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral rights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some jurisdictions.  ### 6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected   6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may independently have under any applicable law to make any use of this Database, including without limitation:    a. Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents   from non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for   purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, and   Extraction or Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative   or judicial procedure.     b. Fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation   or exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws.   6.2 This License does not affect any rights of lawful users to Extract and Re-utilise insubstantial parts of the Contents, evaluated quantitatively or qualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever, including creating a Derivative Database (subject to other rights over the Contents, see Section 2.4). The repeated and systematic Extraction or Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may however amount to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the Contents.  ### 7.0 Warranties and Disclaimer  7.1 The Database is licensed by the Licensor 'as is' and without any warranty of any kind, either express, implied, or arising by statute, custom, course of dealing, or trade usage. Licensor specifically disclaims any and all implied warranties or conditions of title, non-infringement, accuracy or completeness, the presence or absence of errors, fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, or otherwise. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so this exclusion may not apply to You.  ### 8.0 Limitation of liability  8.1 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law, the Licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability for loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use under this License, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused by any fault on the part of the Licensor or not. This exclusion of liability includes, but is not limited to, any special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages such as loss of revenue, data, anticipated profits, and lost business. This exclusion applies even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  8.2 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and direct financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on the part of the Licensor.  ### 9.0 Termination of Your rights under this License  9.1 Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License automatically terminates this License with immediate effect and without notice to You. For the avoidance of doubt, Persons who have received the Database, the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative Databases, or the Database as part of a Collective Database from You under this License will not have their licenses terminated provided their use is in full compliance with this License or a license granted under Section 4.8 of this License.

"language-tags@1.0.5","https://github.com/mattcg/language-tags","MIT","Copyright (c) 2013, [Matthew Caruana Galizia](http://twitter.com/mcaruanagalizia).","# IANA Language Tags for JavaScript #  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mattcg/language-tags.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mattcg/language-tags) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/mattcg/language-tags/badge.png)](https://coveralls.io/r/mattcg/language-tags)  Based on [BCP 47](http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) ([RFC 5646](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646)) and the latest [IANA language subtag registry](http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry).  This project will be updated as the standards change.  ## JSON data ##  See the [language-subtag-registry](https://github.com/mattcg/language-subtag-registry) project for the underlying JSON data.  ## API ##  ```js var tags = require('language-tags') ```  Note that all lookups and checks for tags and subtags are case insensitive. For formatting according to common conventions, see `tag.format`.  ### tags(tag) ###  Check whether a hyphen-separated tag is valid and well-formed. Always returns a `Tag`, which can be checked using the `valid` method.  ### tags.check(tag) ###  Shortcut for `tags(tag).valid()`. Return `true` if the tag is valid, `false` otherwise. For meaningful error output see `tag.errors()`.  ### tags.subtags(subtag), tags.subtags(subtags) ###  Look up one or more subtags. Returns an array of `Subtag` objects. Returns an empty array if all of the subtags are non-existent.  Calling `tags.subtags('mt')` will return an array with two `Subtag` objects: one for Malta (the 'region' type subtag) and one for Maltese (the 'language' type subtag).  ``` > tags.subtags('mt'); [Subtag, Subtag] > tags.subtags('bumblebee'); [] ```  To get or check a single subtag by type use `tags.language(subtag)`, `tags.region(subtag)` or `tags.type(subtag, type)`.  ### tags.filter(subtags) ###  The opposite of `tags.subtags(subtags)`. Returns an array of codes that are not registered subtags, otherwise returns an empty array.  ``` > tags.filter(['en', 'Aargh']); ['Aargh'] ```  ### tags.search(description, [all]) ###  Search for tags and subtags by description. Supports either a RegExp object or a string for `description`. Returns an array of `Subtag` and `Tag` objects or an empty array if no results were found.  Note that `Tag` objects in the results represent 'grandfathered' or 'redundant' tags. These are excluded by default. Set the `all` parameter to `true` to include them.  Search is case-insensitive if `description` is a string.  ### tags.languages(macrolanguage) ###  Returns an array of `Subtag` objects representing all the 'language' type subtags belonging to the given 'macrolanguage' type subtag.  Throws an error if `macrolanguage` is not a macrolanguage.  ``` > tags.languages('zh'); [Subtag, Subtag...] > tags.languages('en'); Error: 'en' is not a valid macrolanguage. ```  ### tags.language(subtag) ###  Convenience method to get a single 'language' type subtag. Can be used to validate an input value as a language subtag. Returns a `Subtag` object or `null`.  ``` > tags.language('en'); Subtag > tags.language('us'); null ```  ### tags.region(subtag) ###  As above, but with 'region' type subtags.  ``` > tags.region('mt'); Subtag > tags.region('en'); null ```  ### tags.type(subtag, type) ###  Get a subtag by type. Returns the subtag matching `type` as a `Subtag` object otherwise returns `null`.  A `type` consists of one of the following strings: 'language', 'extlang', 'script', 'region' or 'variant'. To get a 'grandfathered' or 'redundant' type tag use `tags(tag)`.  ``` > tags.type('zh', 'macrolanguage'); Subtag > tags.type('zh', 'script'); null ```  ### tags.date() ###  Returns the file date for the underlying data, as a string.  ``` > tags.date(); '2004-06-28' ```  ### Subtag ###  #### subtag.type() ####  Get the subtag type (either 'language', 'extlang', 'script', 'region' or 'variant'). See [RFC 5646 section 2.2](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646#section-2.2) for type definitions.  #### subtag.descriptions() ####  Returns an array of description strings (a subtag may have more than one description).  ``` > tags.language('ro').descriptions(); ['Romanian', 'Moldavian', 'Moldovan'] ```  #### subtag.preferred() ####  Returns a preferred subtag as a `Subtag` object if the subtag is deprecated. For example, `ro` is preferred over deprecated `mo`.  ``` > tags.language('mo').preferred(); Subtag ```  #### subtag.script() ####  For subtags of type 'language' or 'extlang', returns a `Subtag` object representing the language's default script. See [RFC 5646 section 3.1.9](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646#section-3.1.9) for a definition of 'Suppress-Script'.  #### subtag.scope() ####  Returns the subtag scope as a string, or `null` if the subtag has no scope.  Tip: if the subtag represents a macrolanguage, you can use `tags.languages(macrolanguage)` to get a list of all the macrolanguage's individual languages.  ``` > tags.language('zh').scope(); 'macrolanguage' > tags.language('nah').scope(); 'collection' ```  #### subtag.deprecated() ####  Returns a date string reflecting the deprecation date if the subtag is deprecated, otherwise returns `null`.  ``` > tags.language('ja').deprecated(); '2008-11-22' ```  #### subtag.added() ####  Returns a date string reflecting the date the subtag was added to the registry.  ``` > tags.language('ja').added(); '2005-10-16' ```  #### subtag.comments() ####  Returns an array of comments, if any, otherwise returns an empty array.  ``` > tags.language('nmf').comments(); ['see ntx'] ```  #### subtag.format() ####  Return the subtag code formatted according to the case conventions defined in [RFC 5646 section 2.1.1](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646#section-2.1.1).  - language codes are made lowercase ('mn' for Mongolian) - script codes are made lowercase with the initial letter capitalized ('Cyrl' for Cyrillic) - country codes are capitalized ('MN' for Mongolia)  ### Tag ###  #### tag.preferred() ####  If the tag is listed as 'deprecated' or 'redundant' it might have a preferred value. This method returns a `Tag` object if so.  ``` > tags('zh-cmn-Hant').preferred(); Tag ```  #### tag.type() ####  Returns `grandfathered` if the tag is grandfathered, `redundant` if the tag is redundant, and `tag` if neither. For a definition of grandfathered and redundant tags, see [RFC 5646 section 2.2.8](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646#section-2.2.8).  #### tag.subtags() ####  Returns an array of subtags making up the tag, as `Subtag` objects.  #### tag.language(), tag.region(), tag.script() ####  Shortcuts for `tag.find('language')`, `tag.find('region')` and `tag.find('script')`.  #### tag.find(type) ####  Find a subtag of the given type from those making up the tag.  #### tag.valid() ####  Returns `true` if the tag is valid, `false` otherwise.  #### tag.errors() ####  Returns an array of `Error` objects if the tag is invalid. The `message` property of each is readable and helpful enough for UI output. The `code` property can be checked against the `Tag.ERR_*` constants. Each error will also have either a `subtag` or `tag` property with the code of the offending tag.  #### tag.format() ####  Format a tag according to the case conventions defined in [RFC 5646 section 2.1.1](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646#section-2.1.1).  ``` > tags('en-gb').format(); 'en-GB' ```  #### tag.deprecated() ####  For grandfathered or redundant tags, returns a date string reflecting the deprecation date if the tag is deprecated.  ``` > tags('zh-cmn-Hant').deprecated(); '2009-07-29' ```  #### tag.added() ####  For grandfathered or redundant tags, returns a date string reflecting the date the tag was added to the registry.  #### tag.descriptions() ####  Returns an array of tag descriptions for grandfathered or redundant tags, otherwise returns an empty array.  ## Resources ##  - [Python version by the Flanders Heritage Agency](https://github.com/OnroerendErfgoed/language-tags) - [Language Subtag Lookup tool by Richard Ishida](http://rishida.net/utils/subtags/) - [W3C Internationalization Checker](http://validator.w3.org/i18n-checker/) - [RFC 5646](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646)  ## Credits and collaboration ##  Copyright (c) 2013, [Matthew Caruana Galizia](http://twitter.com/mcaruanagalizia).

"mdn-data@2.0.14","https://github.com/mdn/data","CC0-1.0","","CC0 1.0 Universal  Statement of Purpose  The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an 'owner') of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a 'Work').  Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ('Commons') that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.  For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the 'Affirmer'), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.  1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ('Copyright and Related Rights'). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:    i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,   and translate a Work;    ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);    iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness   depicted in a Work;    iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,   subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;    v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in   a Work;    vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the   European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal   protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,   including any amended or successor version of such directive); and    vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world   based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.  2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the 'Waiver'). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.  3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the 'License'). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.  4. Limitations and Disclaimers.    a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,   surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.    b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties   of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,   including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness   for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or   other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not   discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.    c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons   that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation   any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer   disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions   or other rights required for any use of the Work.    d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a   party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this   CC0 or use of the Work.

This is described as a 'natural ordering'.  ```text Standard sorting:   Natural order sorting:     img1.png            img1.png     img10.png           img2.png     img12.png           img10.png     img2.png            img12.png ```  String.naturalCompare returns a number indicating whether a reference string comes before or after or is the same as the given string in sort order. Use it with builtin sort() function.    ### Installation  - In browser  ```html <script src=min.natural-compare.js></script> ```  - In node.js: `npm install natural-compare-lite`  ```javascript require('natural-compare-lite') ```  ### Usage  ```javascript // Simple case sensitive example var a = ['z1.doc', 'z10.doc', 'z17.doc', 'z2.doc', 'z23.doc', 'z3.doc']; a.sort(String.naturalCompare); // ['z1.doc', 'z2.doc', 'z3.doc', 'z10.doc', 'z17.doc', 'z23.doc']  // Use wrapper function for case insensitivity a.sort(function(a, b){   return String.naturalCompare(a.toLowerCase(), b.toLowerCase()); })  // In most cases we want to sort an array of objects var a = [ {'street':'350 5th Ave', 'room':'A-1021'}         , {'street':'350 5th Ave', 'room':'A-21046-b'} ];  // sort by street, then by room a.sort(function(a, b){   return String.naturalCompare(a.street, b.street) || String.naturalCompare(a.room, b.room); })  // When text transformation is needed (eg toLowerCase()), // it is best for performance to keep // transformed key in that object. // There are no need to do text transformation // on each comparision when sorting. var a = [ {'make':'Audi', 'model':'A6'}         , {'make':'Kia',  'model':'Rio'} ];  // sort by make, then by model a.map(function(car){   car.sort_key = (car.make + ' ' + car.model).toLowerCase(); }) a.sort(function(a, b){   return String.naturalCompare(a.sort_key, b.sort_key); }) ```  - Works well with dates in ISO format eg 'Rev 2012-07-26.doc'.   ### Custom alphabet  It is possible to configure a custom alphabet to achieve a desired order.  ```javascript // Estonian alphabet String.alphabet = 'ABDEFGHIJKLMNOPRSŠZŽTUVÕÄÖÜXYabdefghijklmnoprsšzžtuvõäöüxy' ['t', 'z', 'x', 'õ'].sort(String.naturalCompare) // ['z', 't', 'õ', 'x']  // Russian alphabet String.alphabet = 'АБВГДЕЁЖЗИЙКЛМНОПРСТУФХЦЧШЩЪЫЬЭЮЯабвгдеёжзийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя' ['Ё', 'А', 'Б'].sort(String.naturalCompare) // ['А', 'Б', 'Ё'] ```   External links --------------  -   [GitHub repo][https://github.com/litejs/natural-compare-lite] -   [jsperf test](http://jsperf.com/natural-sort-2/12)   Licence -------  Copyright (c) 2012-2015 Lauri Rooden &lt;lauri@rooden.ee&gt;   [The MIT License](http://lauri.rooden.ee/mit-license.txt)"

The BSD License is recommended for most projects. It is simple and easy to understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with the Forge project.  If the GPL suits your project better you are also free to use Forge under that license.  You don't have to do anything special to choose one license or the other and you don't have to notify anyone which license you are using. You are free to use this project in commercial projects as long as the copyright header is left intact.  If you are a commercial entity and use this set of libraries in your commercial software then reasonable payment to Digital Bazaar, if you can afford it, is not required but is expected and would be appreciated. If this library saves you time, then it's saving you money. The cost of developing the Forge software was on the order of several hundred hours and tens of thousands of dollars. We are attempting to strike a balance between helping the development community while not being taken advantage of by lucrative commercial entities for our efforts.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- New BSD License (3-clause) Copyright (c) 2010, Digital Bazaar, Inc.

Preamble    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too.    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The 'Program', below, refers to any such program or work, and a 'work based on the Program' means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term 'modification'.)  Each licensee is addressed as 'you'.  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third     parties under the terms of this License.      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium     customarily used for software interchange; or,      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you     received the program in object code or executable form with such     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and 'any later version', you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.            NO WARRANTY    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM 'AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES."

Note that in this case, all loaders will be resolved relative to the package containing your configuration.  In case part of your configuration comes from third-party packages that use their own loaders, make sure they use `require.resolve` - this will ensure that the resolution process is portable accross environments (including when Plug'n'Play isn't enabled), and prevent it from relying on undefined behaviors:  ```js module.exports = {   module: {     rules: [{       test: /\.js$/,       loader: require.resolve('babel-loader'),     }]   }, }; ```  ## License (MIT)  > **Copyright © 2016 Maël Nison** > > Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: > > The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. > > THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

"postcss-browser-comments@3.0.0","https://github.com/csstools/postcss-browser-comments","CC0-1.0","","# CC0 1.0 Universal  ## Statement of Purpose  The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an “owner”) of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a “Work”).  Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works (“Commons”) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.  For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.  1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be    protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and    Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited    to, the following:    1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,       and translate a Work;    2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);    3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness       depicted in a Work;    4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,       subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;    5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in       a Work;    6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the       European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal       protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,       including any amended or successor version of such directive); and    7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world       based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations       thereof.  2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,    applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and    unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright    and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now    known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of    action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum    duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time    extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of    copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation    commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer    makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and    to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that    such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,    termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet    enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express    Statement of Purpose.  3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be    judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver    shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account    Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the    Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a    royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,    irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and    Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the    maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time    extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of    copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation    commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License    shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the    Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally    invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or    ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in    such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any    of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)    assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,    in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.  4. Limitations and Disclaimers.    1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,       surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.    2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties       of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or       otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,       merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or       the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or       absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest       extent permissible under applicable law.    3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons       that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without       limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.       Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary       consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.    4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a       party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this       CC0 or use of the Work.

"postcss-color-mod-function@3.0.3","https://github.com/jonathantneal/postcss-color-mod-function","CC0-1.0","","# CC0 1.0 Universal  ## Statement of Purpose  The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an “owner”) of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a “Work”).  Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works (“Commons”) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.  For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.  1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be    protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and    Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited    to, the following:    1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,       and translate a Work;    2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);    3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness       depicted in a Work;    4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,       subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;    5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in       a Work;    6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the       European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal       protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,       including any amended or successor version of such directive); and    7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world       based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations       thereof.  2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,    applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and    unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright    and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now    known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of    action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum    duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time    extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of    copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation    commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer    makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and    to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that    such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,    termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet    enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express    Statement of Purpose.  3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be    judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver    shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account    Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the    Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a    royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,    irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and    Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the    maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time    extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of    copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation    commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License    shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the    Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally    invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or    ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in    such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any    of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)    assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,    in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.  4. Limitations and Disclaimers.    1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,       surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.    2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties       of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or       otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,       merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or       the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or       absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest       extent permissible under applicable law.    3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons       that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without       limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.       Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary       consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.    4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a       party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this       CC0 or use of the Work.

Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited    to, the following:    1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,       and translate a Work;    2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);    3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness       depicted in a Work;    4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,       subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;    5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in       a Work;    6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the       European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal       protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,       including any amended or successor version of such directive); and    7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world       based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations       thereof.  2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,    applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and    unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright    and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now    known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of    action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum    duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time    extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of    copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation    commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”).

In addition, to the extent the    Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a    royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,    irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and    Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the    maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time    extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of    copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation    commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License    shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the    Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally    invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or    ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in    such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any    of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)    assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,    in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.  4.

Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited    to, the following:    1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,       and translate a Work;    2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);    3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness       depicted in a Work;    4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,       subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;    5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in       a Work;    6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the       European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal       protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,       including any amended or successor version of such directive); and    7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world       based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations       thereof.  2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,    applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and    unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright    and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now    known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of    action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum    duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time    extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of    copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation    commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer    makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and    to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that    such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,    termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet    enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express    Statement of Purpose.  3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be    judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver    shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account    Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the    Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a    royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,    irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and    Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the    maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time    extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of    copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation    commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License    shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the    Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally    invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or    ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in    such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any    of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)    assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,    in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.  4. Limitations and Disclaimers.    1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,       surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.    2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties       of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or       otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,       merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or       the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or       absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest       extent permissible under applicable law.    3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons       that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without       limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.       Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary       consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.    4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a       party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this       CC0 or use of the Work.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.  1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be    protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and    Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited    to, the following:    1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,       and translate a Work;    2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);    3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness       depicted in a Work;    4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,       subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;    5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in       a Work;    6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the       European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal       protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,       including any amended or successor version of such directive); and    7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world       based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations       thereof.  2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,    applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and    unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright    and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now    known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of    action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum    duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time    extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of    copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation    commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer    makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and    to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that    such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,    termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet    enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express    Statement of Purpose.  3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be    judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver    shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account    Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the    Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a    royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,    irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and    Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the    maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time    extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of    copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation    commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License    shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the    Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally    invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or    ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in    such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any    of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)    assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,    in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.  4. Limitations and Disclaimers.    1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,       surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.    2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties       of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or       otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,       merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or       the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or       absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest       extent permissible under applicable law.    3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons       that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without       limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.       Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary       consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.    4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a       party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this       CC0 or use of the Work.

"rework@1.0.1","https://github.com/reworkcss/rework","MIT*","Copyright (c) 2012–2013 TJ Holowaychuk <tj@vision-media.ca>*","# rework [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/reworkcss/rework.png)](https://travis-ci.org/reworkcss/rework)  CSS manipulations built on [`css`](https://github.com/reworkcss/css), allowing you to automate vendor prefixing, create your own properties, inline images, anything you can imagine!  Please refer to [`css`](https://github.com/reworkcss/css) for AST documentation and to report parser/stringifier issues.  ## Installation      $ npm install rework  ## Usage  ```js var rework = require('rework'); var pluginA = require('pluginA'); var pluginB = require('pluginB');  rework('body { font-size: 12px; }', { source: 'source.css' })   .use(pluginA)   .use(pluginB)   .toString({ sourcemap: true }) ```  ## API  ### rework(code, [options])  Accepts a CSS string and returns a new `Rework` instance. The `options` are passed directly to `css.parse`.  ### Rework#use(fn)  Use the given plugin `fn`. A rework 'plugin' is simply a function accepting the stylesheet root node and the `Rework` instance.  ### Rework#toString([options])  Returns the string representation of the manipulated CSS. The `options` are passed directly to `css.stringify`.  Unlike `css.stringify`, if you pass `sourcemap: true` a string will still be returned, with the source map inlined.

"rollup-pluginutils@2.8.2","https://github.com/rollup/rollup-pluginutils","MIT","","# rollup-pluginutils  A set of functions commonly used by Rollup plugins.   ## Installation  ```bash npm install --save rollup-pluginutils ```   ## Usage  ### addExtension  ```js import { addExtension } from 'rollup-pluginutils';  export default function myPlugin ( options = {} ) {   return {     resolveId ( code, id ) {       // only adds an extension if there isn't one already       id = addExtension( id ); // `foo` -> `foo.js`, `foo.js -> foo.js`       id = addExtension( id, '.myext' ); // `foo` -> `foo.myext`, `foo.js -> `foo.js`     }   }; } ```   ### attachScopes  This function attaches `Scope` objects to the relevant nodes of an AST. Each `Scope` object has a `scope.contains(name)` method that returns `true` if a given name is defined in the current scope or a parent scope.  See [rollup-plugin-inject](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-inject) or [rollup-plugin-commonjs](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-commonjs) for an example of usage.  ```js import { attachScopes } from 'rollup-pluginutils'; import { walk } from 'estree-walker';  export default function myPlugin ( options = {} ) {   return {     transform ( code ) {       const ast = this.parse( code );        let scope = attachScopes( ast, 'scope' );        walk( ast, {         enter ( node ) {           if ( node.scope ) scope = node.scope;            if ( !scope.contains( 'foo' ) ) {             // `foo` is not defined, so if we encounter it,             // we assume it's a global           }         },         leave ( node ) {           if ( node.scope ) scope = scope.parent;         }       });     }   }; } ```   ### createFilter  ```js import { createFilter } from 'rollup-pluginutils';  export default function myPlugin ( options = {} ) {   // `options.include` and `options.exclude` can each be a minimatch   // pattern, or an array of minimatch patterns, relative to process.cwd()   var filter = createFilter( options.include, options.exclude );    return {     transform ( code, id ) {       // if `options.include` is omitted or has zero length, filter       // will return `true` by default. Otherwise, an ID must match       // one or more of the minimatch patterns, and must not match       // any of the `options.exclude` patterns.       if ( !filter( id ) ) return;        // proceed with the transformation...     }   }; } ```  If you want to resolve the patterns against a directory other than `process.cwd()`, you can additionally pass a `resolve` option:  ```js var filter = createFilter( options.include, options.exclude, {resolve: '/my/base/dir'} ) ```  If `resolve` is a string, then this value will be used as the base directory. Relative paths will be resolved against `process.cwd()` first. If `resolve` is `false`, then the patterns will not be resolved against any directory. This can be useful if you want to create a filter for virtual module names.   ### makeLegalIdentifier  ```js import { makeLegalIdentifier } from 'rollup-pluginutils';  makeLegalIdentifier( 'foo-bar' ); // 'foo_bar' makeLegalIdentifier( 'typeof' ); // '_typeof' ```  ### dataToEsm  Helper for treeshakable data imports  ```js import { dataToEsm } from 'rollup-pluginutils';  const esModuleSource = dataToEsm({   custom: 'data',   to: ['treeshake'] }, {   compact: false,   indent: '\t',   preferConst: false,   objectShorthand: false,   namedExports: true }); /* Outputs the string ES module source:   export const custom = 'data';   export const to = ['treeshake'];   export default { custom, to }; */ ```  ### extractAssignedNames  Extract the names of all assignment targets from patterns.  ```js import { extractAssignedNames } from 'rollup-pluginutils'; import { walk } from 'estree-walker';  export default function myPlugin ( options = {} ) {   return {     transform ( code ) {       const ast = this.parse( code );        walk( ast, {         enter ( node ) {           if ( node.type === 'VariableDeclarator' ) {           	const declaredNames = extractAssignedNames(node.id);           	// do something with the declared names           	// e.g. for `const {x, y: z} = ... => declaredNames = ['x', 'z']           }         }       });     }   }; } ```   ## License  MIT"

"run-queue@1.0.3","https://github.com/iarna/run-queue","ISC","","# run-queue  A promise based, dynamic priority queue runner, with concurrency limiting.  ```js const RunQueue = require('run-queue')  const queue = new RunQueue({   maxConcurrency: 1 })  queue.add(1, example, [-1]) for (let ii = 0; ii < 5; ++ii) {   queue.add(0, example, [ii]) } const finished = [] queue.run().then(   console.log(finished) })  function example (num, next) {   setTimeout(() => {     finished.push(num)     next()   }, 5 - Math.abs(num)) } ```  would output  ``` [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, -1 ] ```  If you bump concurrency to `2`, then you get:  ``` [ 1, 0, 3, 2, 4, -1 ] ```  The concurrency means that they don't finish in order, because some take longer than others.  Each priority level must finish entirely before the next priority level is run.  See [PRIORITIES](https://github.com/iarna/run-queue#priorities) below.  This is even true if concurrency is set high enough that all of the regular queue can execute at once, for instance, with `maxConcurrency: 10`:  ``` [ 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1 ] ```  ## API  ### const queue = new RunQueue(options)  Create a new queue. Options may contain:  * maxConcurrency - (Default: `1`) The maximum number of jobs to execute at once. * Promise - (Default: global.Promise) The promise implementation to use.  ### queue.add (prio, fn, args)  Add a new job to the end of the queue at priority `prio` that will run `fn` with `args`. If `fn` is async then it should return a Promise.  ### queue.run ()  Start running the job queue.  Returns a Promise that resolves when either all the jobs are complete or a job ends in error (throws or returns a rejected promise). If a job ended in error then this Promise will be rejected with that error and no further queue running will be done.  ## PRIORITIES  Priorities are any integer value >= 0.  Lowest is executed first.  Priorities essentially represent distinct job queues.  All jobs in a queue must complete before the next highest priority job queue is executed.  This means that if you have two queues, `0` and `1` then ALL jobs in `0` must complete before ANY execute in `1`.  If you add new `0` level jobs while `1` level jobs are running then it will switch back processing the `0` queue and won't execute any more `1` jobs till all of the new `0` jobs complete."

"sane@4.1.0","https://github.com/amasad/sane","MIT","","[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/amasad/sane.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/amasad/sane)  sane ----  I've been driven to insanity by node filesystem watcher wrappers. Sane aims to be fast, small, and reliable file system watcher. It does that by:  * By default stays away from fs polling because it's very slow and cpu intensive * Uses `fs.watch` by default and sensibly works around the various issues * Maintains a consistent API across different platforms * Where `fs.watch` is not reliable you have the choice of using the following alternatives:   * [the facebook watchman library](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/)   * [the watchexec library](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec)   * polling  ## Install  ``` $ npm install sane ```  ## How to choose a mode  Don't worry too much about choosing the correct mode upfront because sane maintains the same API across all modes and will be easy to switch.  * If you're only supporting Linux and OS X, `watchman` would be the most reliable mode * If you're using node > v0.10.0 use the default mode * If you're running OS X and you're watching a lot of directories and you're running into https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/5463, use `watchman` * If you're in an environment where native file system events aren't available (like Vagrant), you should use polling * Otherwise, the default mode should work well for you  ## API  ### sane(dir, options)  Watches a directory and all its descendant directories for changes, deletions, and additions on files and directories.  ```js var watcher = sane('path/to/dir', {glob: ['**/*.js', '**/*.css']}); watcher.on('ready', function () { console.log('ready') }); watcher.on('change', function (filepath, root, stat) { console.log('file changed', filepath); }); watcher.on('add', function (filepath, root, stat) { console.log('file added', filepath); }); watcher.on('delete', function (filepath, root) { console.log('file deleted', filepath); }); // close watcher.close(); ```  options:  * `glob`: a single string glob pattern or an array of them. * `poll`: puts the watcher in polling mode. Under the hood that means `fs.watchFile`. * `watchman`: makes the watcher use [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/). * `watchmanPath`: sets a custom path for `watchman` binary. * `watchexec`: makes the watcher use [watchexec](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec). * `dot`: enables watching files/directories that start with a dot. * `ignored`: a glob, regex, function, or array of any combination.  For the glob pattern documentation, see [micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch). If you choose to use `watchman` you'll have to [install watchman yourself](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html)). If you choose to use `watchexec` you'll have to [install watchexec yourself](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec)). For the ignored options, see [anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch).  ### sane.NodeWatcher(dir, options)  The default watcher class. Uses `fs.watch` under the hood, and takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.  ### sane.WatchmanWatcher(dir, options)  The watchman watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.  ### sane.Watchexec(dir, options)  The watchexec watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.  ### sane.PollWatcher(dir, options)  The polling watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)` with the addition of:  * interval: indicates how often the files should be polled. (passed to fs.watchFile)  ### sane.{Node|Watchman|Watchexec|Poll}Watcher#close  Stops watching.  ### sane.{Node|Watchman|Watchexec|Poll}Watcher events  Emits the following events:  All events are passed the file/dir path relative to the root directory * `ready` when the program is ready to detect events in the directory * `change` when a file changes * `add` when a file or directory has been added * `delete` when a file or directory has been deleted  ## CLI  This module includes a simple command line interface, which you can install with `npm install sane -g`.  ``` Usage: sane <command> [...directory] [--glob=<filePattern>] [--poll] [--watchman] [--watchman-path=<watchmanBinaryPath>] [--dot] [--wait=<seconds>]  OPTIONS:     --glob=<filePattern>       A single string glob pattern or an array of them.      --ignored=<filePattern>       A glob, regex, function, or array of any combination.      --poll, -p       Use polling mode.      --watchman, -w       Use watchman (if available).      --watchman-path=<watchmanBinaryPath>       Sets a custom path for watchman binary (if using this mode).      --dot, -d       Enables watching files/directories that start with a dot.      --wait=<seconds>       Duration, in seconds, that watching will be disabled       after running <command>. Setting this option will       throttle calls to <command> for the specified duration.     --quiet, -q       Disables sane's console output      --changes-only, -o       Runs <command> only when a change occur. Skips running <command> at startup ```  It will watch the given `directory` and run the given <command> every time a file changes.  ### CLI example usage - `sane 'echo 'A command ran''` - `sane 'echo 'A command ran'' --glob='**/*.css'` - `sane 'echo 'A command ran'' site/assets/css --glob='**/*.css'` - `sane 'echo 'A command ran'' --glob='**/*.css' --ignored='**/ignore.css'` - `sane 'echo 'A command ran'' --wait=3` - `sane 'echo 'A command ran'' -p`  ## License  MIT  ## Credits The CLI was originally based on the [watch CLI](https://github.com/mikeal/watch).

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works (“Commons”) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.  For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.  1.

"saxes@5.0.1","https://github.com/lddubeau/saxes","ISC","","# saxes  A sax-style non-validating parser for XML.  Saxes is a fork of [sax](https://github.com/isaacs/sax-js) 1.2.4. All mentions of sax in this project's documentation are references to sax 1.2.4.  Designed with [node](http://nodejs.org/) in mind, but should work fine in the browser or other CommonJS implementations.  Saxes does not support Node versions older than 10.  ## Notable Differences from Sax.  * Saxes aims to be much stricter than sax with regards to XML   well-formedness. Sax, even in its so-called 'strict mode', is not strict. It   silently accepts structures that are not well-formed XML. Projects that need   better compliance with well-formedness constraints cannot use sax as-is.    Consequently, saxes does not support HTML, or pseudo-XML, or bad XML. Saxes   will report well-formedness errors in all these cases but it won't try to   extract data from malformed documents like sax does.  * Saxes is much much faster than sax, mostly because of a substantial redesign   of the internal parsing logic. The speed improvement is not merely due to   removing features that were supported by sax. That helped a bit, but saxes   adds some expensive checks in its aim for conformance with the XML   specification. Redesigning the parsing logic is what accounts for most of the   performance improvement.  * Saxes does not aim to support antiquated platforms. We will not pollute the   source or the default build with support for antiquated platforms. If you want   support for IE 11, you are welcome to produce a PR that adds a *new build*   transpiled to ES5.  * Saxes handles errors differently from sax: it provides a default onerror   handler which throws. You can replace it with your own handler if you want. If   your handler does nothing, there is no `resume` method to call.  * There's no `Stream` API. A revamped API may be introduced later. (It is still   a 'streaming parser' in the general sense that you write a character stream to   it.)  * Saxes does not have facilities for limiting the size the data chunks passed to   event handlers. See the FAQ entry for more details.  ## Conformance  Saxes supports:  * [XML 1.0 fifth edition](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/) * [XML 1.1 second edition](https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml11-20060816/) * [Namespaces in XML 1.0 (Third Edition)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-xml-names-20091208/). * [Namespaces in XML 1.1 (Second Edition)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml-names11-20060816/).  ## Limitations  This is a non-validating parser so it only verifies whether the document is well-formed. We do aim to raise errors for all malformed constructs encountered. However, this parser does not thorougly parse the contents of DTDs. So most malformedness errors caused by errors **in DTDs** cannot be reported.  ## Regarding `<!DOCTYPE` and `<!ENTITY`  The parser will handle the basic XML entities in text nodes and attribute values: `&amp; &lt; &gt; &apos; &quot;`. It's possible to define additional entities in XML by putting them in the DTD. This parser doesn't do anything with that. If you want to listen to the `doctype` event, and then fetch the doctypes, and read the entities and add them to `parser.ENTITIES`, then be my guest.  ## Documentation  The source code contains JSDOC comments. Use them. What follows is a brief summary of what is available. The final authority is the source code.  **PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO WHAT IS PUBLIC AND WHAT IS PRIVATE.**  The move to TypeScript makes it so that everything is now formally private, protected, or public.  If you use anything not public, that's at your own peril.  If there's a mistake in the documentation, raise an issue. If you just assume, you may assume incorrectly.  ## Summary Usage Information  ### Example  ```javascript var saxes = require('./lib/saxes'),   parser = new saxes.SaxesParser();  parser.on('error', function (e) {   // an error happened. }); parser.on('text', function (t) {   // got some text.  t is the string of text. }); parser.on('opentag', function (node) {   // opened a tag.  node has 'name' and 'attributes' }); parser.on('end', function () {   // parser stream is done, and ready to have more stuff written to it. });  parser.write('<xml>Hello, <who name='world'>world</who>!</xml>').close(); ```  ### Constructor Arguments  Settings supported:  * `xmlns` - Boolean. If `true`, then namespaces are supported. Default   is `false`.  * `position` - Boolean. If `false`, then don't track line/col/position. Unset is   treated as `true`. Default is unset. Currently, setting this to `false` only   results in a cosmetic change: the errors reported do not contain position   information. sax-js would literally turn off the position-computing logic if   this flag was set to false. The notion was that it would optimize   execution. In saxes at least it turns out that continually testing this flag   causes a cost that offsets the benefits of turning off this logic.  * `fileName` - String. Set a file name for error reporting. This is useful only   when tracking positions. You may leave it unset.  * `fragment` - Boolean. If `true`, parse the XML as an XML fragment. Default is   `false`.  * `additionalNamespaces` - A plain object whose key, value pairs define    namespaces known before parsing the XML file. It is not legal to pass    bindings for the namespaces `'xml'` or `'xmlns'`.  * `defaultXMLVersion` - The default version of the XML specification to use if   the document contains no XML declaration. If the document does contain an XML   declaration, then this setting is ignored. Must be `'1.0'` or `'1.1'`. The   default is `'1.0'`.  * `forceXMLVersion` - Boolean. A flag indicating whether to force the XML   version used for parsing to the value of ``defaultXMLVersion``. When this flag   is ``true``, ``defaultXMLVersion`` must be specified. If unspecified, the   default value of this flag is ``false``.    Example: suppose you are parsing a document that has an XML declaration   specifying XML version 1.1.    If you set ``defaultXMLVersion`` to ``'1.0'`` without setting   ``forceXMLVersion`` then the XML declaration will override the value of   ``defaultXMLVersion`` and the document will be parsed according to XML 1.1.    If you set ``defaultXMLVersion`` to ``'1.0'`` and set ``forceXMLVersion`` to   ``true``, then the XML declaration will be ignored and the document will be   parsed according to XML 1.0.  ### Methods  `write` - Write bytes onto the stream. You don't have to pass the whole document in one `write` call. You can read your source chunk by chunk and call `write` with each chunk.  `close` - Close the stream. Once closed, no more data may be written until it is done processing the buffer, which is signaled by the `end` event.  ### Properties  The parser has the following properties:  `line`, `column`, `columnIndex`, `position` - Indications of the position in the XML document where the parser currently is looking. The `columnIndex` property counts columns as if indexing into a JavaScript string, whereas the `column` property counts Unicode characters.  `closed` - Boolean indicating whether or not the parser can be written to.  If it's `true`, then wait for the `ready` event to write again.  `opt` - Any options passed into the constructor.  `xmlDecl` - The XML declaration for this document. It contains the fields `version`, `encoding` and `standalone`. They are all `undefined` before encountering the XML declaration. If they are undefined after the XML declaration, the corresponding value was not set by the declaration. There is no event associated with the XML declaration. In a well-formed document, the XML declaration may be preceded only by an optional BOM. So by the time any event generated by the parser happens, the declaration has been processed if present at all. Otherwise, you have a malformed document, and as stated above, you cannot rely on the parser data!  ### Error Handling  The parser continues to parse even upon encountering errors, and does its best to continue reporting errors. You should heed all errors reported. After an error, however, saxes may interpret your document incorrectly. For instance ``<foo a=bc='d'/>`` is invalid XML. Did you mean to have ``<foo a='bc=d'/>`` or ``<foo a='b' c='d'/>`` or some other variation?  For the sake of continuing to provide errors, saxes will continue parsing the document, but the structure it reports may be incorrect. It is only after the errors are fixed in the document that saxes can provide a reliable interpretation of the document.  That leaves you with two rules of thumb when using saxes:  * Pay attention to the errors that saxes report. The default `onerror` handler   throws, so by default, you cannot miss errors.  * **ONCE AN ERROR HAS BEEN ENCOUNTERED, STOP RELYING ON THE EVENT HANDLERS OTHER   THAN `onerror`.** As explained above, when saxes runs into a well-formedness   problem, it makes a guess in order to continue reporting more errors. The guess   may be wrong.  ### Events  To listen to an event, override `on<eventname>`. The list of supported events are also in the exported `EVENTS` array.  See the JSDOC comments in the source code for a description of each supported event.  ### Parsing XML Fragments  The XML specification does not define any method by which to parse XML fragments. However, there are usage scenarios in which it is desirable to parse fragments. In order to allow this, saxes provides three initialization options.  If you pass the option `fragment: true` to the parser constructor, the parser will expect an XML fragment. It essentially starts with a parsing state equivalent to the one it would be in if `parser.write('<foo'>)` had been called right after initialization. In other words, it expects content which is acceptable inside an element. This also turns off well-formedness checks that are inappropriate when parsing a fragment.  The option `additionalNamespaces` allows you to define additional prefix-to-URI bindings known before parsing starts. You would use this over `resolvePrefix` if you have at the ready a series of namespaces bindings to use.  The option `resolvePrefix` allows you to pass a function which saxes will use if it is unable to resolve a namespace prefix by itself. You would use this over `additionalNamespaces` in a context where getting a complete list of defined namespaces is onerous.  Note that you can use `additionalNamespaces` and `resolvePrefix` together if you want. `additionalNamespaces` applies before `resolvePrefix`.  The options `additionalNamespaces` and `resolvePrefix` are really meant to be used for parsing fragments. However, saxes won't prevent you from using them with `fragment: false`. Note that if you do this, your document may parse without errors and yet be malformed because the document can refer to namespaces which are not defined *in* the document.  Of course, `additionalNamespaces` and `resolvePrefix` are used only if `xmlns` is `true`. If you are parsing a fragment that does not use namespaces, there's no point in setting these options.  ### Performance Tips  * saxes works faster on files that use newlines (``\u000A``) as end of line   markers than files that use other end of line markers (like ``\r`` or   ``\r\n``). The XML specification requires that conformant applications behave   as if all characters that are to be treated as end of line characters are   converted to ``\u000A`` prior to parsing. The optimal code path for saxes is a   file in which all end of line characters are already ``\u000A``.  * Don't split Unicode strings you feed to saxes across surrogates. When you   naively split a string in JavaScript, you run the risk of splitting a Unicode   character into two surrogates. e.g.  In the following example ``a`` and ``b``   each contain half of a single Unicode character: ``const a = '\u{1F4A9}'[0];   const b = '\u{1F4A9}'[1]`` If you feed such split surrogates to versions of   saxes prior to 4, you'd get errors. Saxes version 4 and over are able to   detect when a chunk of data ends with a surrogate and carry over the surrogate   to the next chunk. However this operation entails slicing and concatenating   strings. If you can feed your data in a way that does not split surrogates,   you should do it. (Obviously, feeding all the data at once with a single write   is fastest.)  * Don't set event handlers you don't need. Saxes has always aimed to avoid doing   work that will just be tossed away but future improvements hope to do this   more aggressively. One way saxes knows whether or not some data is needed is   by checking whether a handler has been set for a specific event.  ## FAQ  Q. Why has saxes dropped support for limiting the size of data chunks passed to event handlers?  A. With sax you could set ``MAX_BUFFER_LENGTH`` to cause the parser to limit the size of data chunks passed to event handlers. So if you ran into a span of text above the limit, multiple ``text`` events with smaller data chunks were fired instead of a single event with a large chunk.  However, that functionality had some problematic characteristics. It had an arbitrary default value. It was library-wide so all parsers created from a single instance of the ``sax`` library shared it. This could potentially cause conflicts among libraries running in the same VM but using sax for different purposes.  These issues could have been easily fixed, but there were larger issues. The buffer limit arbitrarily applied to some events but not others. It would split ``text``, ``cdata`` and ``script`` events. However, if a ``comment``, ``doctype``, ``attribute`` or ``processing instruction`` were more than the limit, the parser would generate an error and you were left picking up the pieces.  It was not intuitive to use. You'd think setting the limit to 1K would prevent chunks bigger than 1K to be passed to event handlers. But that was not the case. A comment in the source code told you that you might go over the limit if you passed large chunks to ``write``. So if you want a 1K limit, don't pass 64K chunks to ``write``. Fair enough. You know what limit you want so you can control the size of the data you pass to ``write``. So you limit the chunks to ``write`` to 1K at a time. Even if you do this, your event handlers may get data chunks that are 2K in size. Suppose on the previous ``write`` the parser has just finished processing an open tag, so it is ready for text. Your ``write`` passes 1K of text. You are not above the limit yet, so no event is generated yet. The next ``write`` passes another 1K of text. It so happens that sax checks buffer limits only once per ``write``, after the chunk of data has been processed. Now you've hit the limit and you get a ``text`` event with 2K of data. So even if you limit your ``write`` calls to the buffer limit you've set, you may still get events with chunks at twice the buffer size limit you've specified.  We may consider reinstating an equivalent functionality, provided that it addresses the issues above and does not cause a huge performance drop for use-case scenarios that don't need it."

'Derivative Works' shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.        'Contribution' shall mean any work of authorship, including       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of       the copyright owner.

Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

"spdy@4.0.2","https://github.com/indutny/node-spdy","MIT","Copyright Fedor Indutny, 2015.","# SPDY Server for node.js  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spdy-http2/node-spdy.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/spdy-http2/node-spdy) [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/spdy.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/spdy) [![dependencies Status](https://david-dm.org/spdy-http2/node-spdy/status.svg?style=flat-square)](https://david-dm.org/spdy-http2/node-spdy) [![Standard - JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://standardjs.com/) [![Waffle](https://img.shields.io/badge/track-waffle-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://waffle.io/spdy-http2/node-spdy)  With this module you can create [HTTP2][0] / [SPDY][1] servers in node.js with natural http module interface and fallback to regular https (for browsers that don't support neither HTTP2, nor SPDY yet).  This module named `spdy` but it [provides](https://github.com/indutny/node-spdy/issues/269#issuecomment-239014184) support for both http/2 (h2) and spdy (2,3,3.1). Also, `spdy` is compatible with Express.  ## Usage  ### Examples  Server: ```javascript var spdy = require('spdy'),     fs = require('fs');  var options = {   // Private key   key: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-key.pem'),    // Fullchain file or cert file (prefer the former)   cert: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-fullchain.pem'),    // **optional** SPDY-specific options   spdy: {     protocols: [ 'h2', 'spdy/3.1', ..., 'http/1.1' ],     plain: false,      // **optional**     // Parse first incoming X_FORWARDED_FOR frame and put it to the     // headers of every request.     // NOTE: Use with care! This should not be used without some proxy that     // will *always* send X_FORWARDED_FOR     'x-forwarded-for': true,      connection: {       windowSize: 1024 * 1024, // Server's window size        // **optional** if true - server will send 3.1 frames on 3.0 *plain* spdy       autoSpdy31: false     }   } };  var server = spdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {   res.writeHead(200);   res.end('hello world!'); });  server.listen(3000); ```  Client: ```javascript var spdy = require('spdy'); var https = require('https');  var agent = spdy.createAgent({   host: 'www.google.com',   port: 443,    // Optional SPDY options   spdy: {     plain: false,     ssl: true,      // **optional** send X_FORWARDED_FOR     'x-forwarded-for': '127.0.0.1'   } });  https.get({   host: 'www.google.com',   agent: agent }, function(response) {   console.log('yikes');   // Here it goes like with any other node.js HTTP request   // ...   // And once we're done - we may close TCP connection to server   // NOTE: All non-closed requests will die!   agent.close(); }).end(); ```  Please note that if you use a custom agent, by default all connection-level errors will result in an uncaught exception. To handle these errors subscribe to the `error` event and re-emit the captured error:  ```javascript var agent = spdy.createAgent({   host: 'www.google.com',   port: 443 }).once('error', function (err) {   this.emit(err); }); ```  #### Push streams  It is possible to initiate [PUSH_PROMISE][5] to send content to clients _before_ the client requests it.  ```javascript spdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {   var stream = res.push('/main.js', {     status: 200, // optional     method: 'GET', // optional     request: {       accept: '*/*'     },     response: {       'content-type': 'application/javascript'     }   });   stream.on('error', function() {   });   stream.end('alert('hello from push stream!');');    res.end('<script src='/main.js'></script>'); }).listen(3000); ```  [PUSH_PROMISE][5] may be sent using the `push()` method on the current response object.  The signature of the `push()` method is:  `.push('/some/relative/url', { request: {...}, response: {...} }, callback)`  Second argument contains headers for both PUSH_PROMISE and emulated response. `callback` will receive two arguments: `err` (if any error is happened) and a [Duplex][4] stream as the second argument.  Client usage: ```javascript var agent = spdy.createAgent({ /* ... */ }); var req = http.get({   host: 'www.google.com',   agent: agent }, function(response) { }); req.on('push', function(stream) {   stream.on('error', function(err) {     // Handle error   });   // Read data from stream }); ```  NOTE: You're responsible for the `stream` object once given it in `.push()` callback or `push` event. Hence ignoring `error` event on it will result in uncaught exception and crash your program.  #### Trailing headers  Server usage: ```javascript function (req, res) {   // Send trailing headers to client   res.addTrailers({ header1: 'value1', header2: 'value2' });    // On client's trailing headers   req.on('trailers', function(headers) {     // ...   }); } ```  Client usage: ```javascript var req = http.request({ agent: spdyAgent, /* ... */ }).function (res) {   // On server's trailing headers   res.on('trailers', function(headers) {     // ...   }); }); req.write('stuff'); req.addTrailers({ /* ... */ }); req.end(); ```  #### Options  All options supported by [tls][2] work with node-spdy.  Additional options may be passed via `spdy` sub-object:  * `plain` - if defined, server will ignore NPN and ALPN data and choose whether   to use spdy or plain http by looking at first data packet. * `ssl` - if `false` and `options.plain` is `true`, `http.Server` will be used   as a `base` class for created server. * `maxChunk` - if set and non-falsy, limits number of bytes sent in one DATA   chunk. Setting it to non-zero value is recommended if you care about   interleaving of outgoing data from multiple different streams.   (defaults to 8192) * `protocols` - list of NPN/ALPN protocols to use (default is:   `['h2','spdy/3.1', 'spdy/3', 'spdy/2','http/1.1', 'http/1.0']`) * `protocol` - use specific protocol if no NPN/ALPN ex In addition, * `maxStreams` - set '[maximum concurrent streams][3]' protocol option  ### API  API is compatible with `http` and `https` module, but you can use another function as base class for SPDYServer.  ```javascript spdy.createServer(   [base class constructor, i.e. https.Server],   { /* keys and options */ }, // <- the only one required argument   [request listener] ).listen([port], [host], [callback]); ```  Request listener will receive two arguments: `request` and `response`. They're both instances of `http`'s `IncomingMessage` and `OutgoingMessage`. But three custom properties are added to both of them: `isSpdy`, `spdyVersion`. `isSpdy` is `true` when the request was processed using HTTP2/SPDY protocols, it is `false` in case of HTTP/1.1 fallback. `spdyVersion` is either of: `2`, `3`, `3.1`, or `4` (for HTTP2).   #### Contributors  * [Fedor Indutny](https://github.com/indutny) * [Chris Strom](https://github.com/eee-c) * [François de Metz](https://github.com/francois2metz) * [Ilya Grigorik](https://github.com/igrigorik) * [Roberto Peon](https://github.com/grmocg) * [Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa](https://github.com/tatsuhiro-t) * [Jesse Cravens](https://github.com/jessecravens)  #### LICENSE  This software is licensed under the MIT License.

"stable@0.1.8","https://github.com/Two-Screen/stable","MIT","Copyright (C) 2018 Angry Bytes and contributors.","## Stable  A stable array sort, because `Array#sort()` is not guaranteed stable.  MIT licensed.  [![Node.js CI](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Two-Screen/stable.png)](http://travis-ci.org/Two-Screen/stable)  [![Browser CI](http://ci.testling.com/Two-Screen/stable.png)](http://ci.testling.com/Two-Screen/stable)  #### From npm  Install with:  ```sh npm install stable ```  Then use it in Node.js or some other CommonJS environment as:  ```js const stable = require('stable') ```  #### From the browser  Include [`stable.js`] or the minified version [`stable.min.js`] in your page, then call `stable()`.   [`stable.js`]: https://raw.github.com/Two-Screen/stable/master/stable.js  [`stable.min.js`]: https://raw.github.com/Two-Screen/stable/master/stable.min.js  #### Usage  The default sort is, as with `Array#sort`, lexicographical:  ```js stable(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'])  // => ['bar', 'baz', 'foo'] stable([10, 1, 5])             // => [1, 10, 5] ```  Unlike `Array#sort`, the default sort is **NOT** in-place. To do an in-place sort, use `stable.inplace`, which otherwise works the same:  ```js const arr = [10, 1, 5] stable(arr) === arr          // => false stable.inplace(arr) === arr  // => true ```  A comparator function can be specified:  ```js // Regular sort() compatible comparator, that returns a number. // This demonstrates the default behavior. const lexCmp = (a, b) => String(a).localeCompare(b) stable(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'], lexCmp)  // => ['bar', 'baz', 'foo']  // Boolean comparator. Sorts `b` before `a` if true. // This demonstrates a simple way to sort numerically. const greaterThan = (a, b) => a > b stable([10, 1, 5], greaterThan)  // => [1, 5, 10] ```  #### License  Copyright (C) 2018 Angry Bytes and contributors.

If you just want to write TypeScript and have it Just Work™, take a look at [`pnp-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/arcanis/pnp-webpack-plugin#ts-loader-integration) instead.*  This package exports a function that can be used to implement the [`resolveModuleName` hook from `CompilerHost`](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Using-the-Compiler-API#customizing-module-resolution). It mimics the interface from the one you'd typically use and, as all other PnP plugins, works just fine whether your application is actually running under PnP or not.  ```js import {resolveModuleName} from 'ts-pnp'; import * as ts from 'typescript';  function createCompilerHost(   compilerOptions: ts.CompilerOptions, ): ts.CompilerHost {   const compilerHost = {     resolveModuleNames,     resolveTypeReferenceDirectives,   };    return compilerHost;    function resolveModuleNames(moduleNames: string[], containingFile: string) {     return moduleNames.map(moduleName => {       return resolveModuleName(moduleName, containingFile, compilerOptions, compilerHost, ts.resolveModuleName).resolvedModule;     });   }    function resolveTypeReferenceDirectives(typeDirectiveNames: string[], containingFile: string) {     return typeDirectiveNames.map(typeDirectiveName => {       return resolveModuleName(typeDirectiveName, containingFile, compilerOptions, compilerHost, ts.resolveTypeReferenceDirective).resolvedTypeReferenceDirective;     });   } } ```  ## License (MIT)  > **Copyright © 2016 Maël Nison** > > Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: > > The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. > > THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

"uniqs@2.0.0","https://github.com/fgnass/uniqs","MIT","","[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fgnass/uniqs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fgnass/uniqs)  ### Tiny utility to create unions and de-duplicated lists.  Example:  ```js var uniqs = require('uniqs');  var foo = { foo: 23 }; var list = [3, 2, 2, 1, foo, foo];  uniqs(list); // => [3, 2, 1, { foo: 23 }] ```  You can pass multiple lists to create a union:  ```js uniqs([2, 1, 1], [2, 3, 3, 4], [4, 3, 2]); // => [2, 1, 3, 4] ```  Passing individual items works too: ```js uniqs(3, 2, 2, [1, 1, 2]); // => [3, 2, 1] ```  ### Summary  * Uniqueness is defined based on strict object equality. * The lists do not need to be sorted. * The resulting array contains the items in the order of their first appearance.  ### About  This package has been written to accompany utilities like [flatten](https://npmjs.org/package/flatten) as alternative to full-blown libraries like underscore or lodash.  The implementation is optimized for simplicity rather than performance and looks like this:  ```js module.exports = function uniqs() {   var list = Array.prototype.concat.apply([], arguments);   return list.filter(function(item, i) {     return i == list.indexOf(item);   }); }; ```  ### License MIT"

The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

"websocket-driver@0.6.5","https://github.com/faye/websocket-driver-node","MIT","Copyright (c) 2010-2016 James Coglan","# websocket-driver [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/faye/websocket-driver-node.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/faye/websocket-driver-node)  This module provides a complete implementation of the WebSocket protocols that can be hooked up to any I/O stream. It aims to simplify things by decoupling the protocol details from the I/O layer, such that users only need to implement code to stream data in and out of it without needing to know anything about how the protocol actually works. Think of it as a complete WebSocket system with pluggable I/O.  Due to this design, you get a lot of things for free. In particular, if you hook this module up to some I/O object, it will do all of this for you:  * Select the correct server-side driver to talk to the client * Generate and send both server- and client-side handshakes * Recognize when the handshake phase completes and the WS protocol begins * Negotiate subprotocol selection based on `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` * Negotiate and use extensions via the   [websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node)   module * Buffer sent messages until the handshake process is finished * Deal with proxies that defer delivery of the draft-76 handshake body * Notify you when the socket is open and closed and when messages arrive * Recombine fragmented messages * Dispatch text, binary, ping, pong and close frames * Manage the socket-closing handshake process * Automatically reply to ping frames with a matching pong * Apply masking to messages sent by the client  This library was originally extracted from the [Faye](http://faye.jcoglan.com) project but now aims to provide simple WebSocket support for any Node-based project.   ## Installation  ``` $ npm install websocket-driver ```   ## Usage  This module provides protocol drivers that have the same interface on the server and on the client. A WebSocket driver is an object with two duplex streams attached; one for incoming/outgoing messages and one for managing the wire protocol over an I/O stream. The full API is described below.   ### Server-side with HTTP  A Node webserver emits a special event for 'upgrade' requests, and this is where you should handle WebSockets. You first check whether the request is a WebSocket, and if so you can create a driver and attach the request's I/O stream to it.  ```js var http = require('http'),     websocket = require('websocket-driver');  var server = http.createServer();  server.on('upgrade', function(request, socket, body) {   if (!websocket.isWebSocket(request)) return;    var driver = websocket.http(request);    driver.io.write(body);   socket.pipe(driver.io).pipe(socket);    driver.messages.on('data', function(message) {     console.log('Got a message', message);   });    driver.start(); }); ```  Note the line `driver.io.write(body)` - you must pass the `body` buffer to the socket driver in order to make certain versions of the protocol work.   ### Server-side with TCP  You can also handle WebSocket connections in a bare TCP server, if you're not using an HTTP server and don't want to implement HTTP parsing yourself.  The driver will emit a `connect` event when a request is received, and at this point you can detect whether it's a WebSocket and handle it as such. Here's an example using the Node `net` module:  ```js var net = require('net'),     websocket = require('websocket-driver');  var server = net.createServer(function(connection) {   var driver = websocket.server();    driver.on('connect', function() {     if (websocket.isWebSocket(driver)) {       driver.start();     } else {       // handle other HTTP requests     }   });    driver.on('close', function() { connection.end() });   connection.on('error', function() {});    connection.pipe(driver.io).pipe(connection);    driver.messages.pipe(driver.messages); });  server.listen(4180); ```  In the `connect` event, the driver gains several properties to describe the request, similar to a Node request object, such as `method`, `url` and `headers`. However you should remember it's not a real request object; you cannot write data to it, it only tells you what request data we parsed from the input.  If the request has a body, it will be in the `driver.body` buffer, but only as much of the body as has been piped into the driver when the `connect` event fires.   ### Client-side  Similarly, to implement a WebSocket client you just need to make a driver by passing in a URL. After this you use the driver API as described below to process incoming data and send outgoing data.   ```js var net = require('net'),     websocket = require('websocket-driver');  var driver = websocket.client('ws://www.example.com/socket'),     tcp = net.connect(80, 'www.example.com');  tcp.pipe(driver.io).pipe(tcp);  tcp.on('connect', function() {   driver.start(); });  driver.messages.on('data', function(message) {   console.log('Got a message', message); }); ```  Client drivers have two additional properties for reading the HTTP data that was sent back by the server:  * `driver.statusCode` - the integer value of the HTTP status code * `driver.headers` - an object containing the response headers   ### HTTP Proxies  The client driver supports connections via HTTP proxies using the `CONNECT` method. Instead of sending the WebSocket handshake immediately, it will send a `CONNECT` request, wait for a `200` response, and then proceed as normal.  To use this feature, call `driver.proxy(url)` where `url` is the origin of the proxy, including a username and password if required. This produces a duplex stream that you should pipe in and out of your TCP connection to the proxy server. When the proxy emits `connect`, you can then pipe `driver.io` to your TCP stream and call `driver.start()`.  ```js var net = require('net'),     websocket = require('websocket-driver');  var driver = websocket.client('ws://www.example.com/socket'),     proxy  = driver.proxy('http://username:password@proxy.example.com'),     tcp    = net.connect(80, 'proxy.example.com');  tcp.pipe(proxy).pipe(tcp, {end: false});  tcp.on('connect', function() {   proxy.start(); });  proxy.on('connect', function() {   driver.io.pipe(tcp).pipe(driver.io);   driver.start(); });  driver.messages.on('data', function(message) {   console.log('Got a message', message); }); ```  The proxy's `connect` event is also where you should perform a TLS handshake on your TCP stream, if you are connecting to a `wss:` endpoint.  In the event that proxy connection fails, `proxy` will emit an `error`. You can inspect the proxy's response via `proxy.statusCode` and `proxy.headers`.  ```js proxy.on('error', function(error) {   console.error(error.message);   console.log(proxy.statusCode);   console.log(proxy.headers); }); ```  Before calling `proxy.start()` you can set custom headers using `proxy.setHeader()`:  ```js proxy.setHeader('User-Agent', 'node'); proxy.start(); ```   ### Driver API  Drivers are created using one of the following methods:  ```js driver = websocket.http(request, options) driver = websocket.server(options) driver = websocket.client(url, options) ```  The `http` method returns a driver chosen using the headers from a Node HTTP request object. The `server` method returns a driver that will parse an HTTP request and then decide which driver to use for it using the `http` method. The `client` method always returns a driver for the RFC version of the protocol with masking enabled on outgoing frames.  The `options` argument is optional, and is an object. It may contain the following fields:  * `maxLength` - the maximum allowed size of incoming message frames, in bytes.   The default value is `2^26 - 1`, or 1 byte short of 64 MiB. * `protocols` - an array of strings representing acceptable subprotocols for use   over the socket. The driver will negotiate one of these to use via the   `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header if supported by the other peer.  A driver has two duplex streams attached to it:  * <b>`driver.io`</b> - this stream should be attached to an I/O socket like a   TCP stream. Pipe incoming TCP chunks to this stream for them to be parsed, and   pipe this stream back into TCP to send outgoing frames. * <b>`driver.messages`</b> - this stream emits messages received over the   WebSocket.  Writing to it sends messages to the other peer by emitting frames   via the `driver.io` stream.  All drivers respond to the following API methods, but some of them are no-ops depending on whether the client supports the behaviour.  Note that most of these methods are commands: if they produce data that should be sent over the socket, they will give this to you by emitting `data` events on the `driver.io` stream.  #### `driver.on('open', function(event) {})`  Adds a callback to execute when the socket becomes open.  #### `driver.on('message', function(event) {})`  Adds a callback to execute when a message is received. `event` will have a `data` attribute containing either a string in the case of a text message or a `Buffer` in the case of a binary message.  You can also listen for messages using the `driver.messages.on('data')` event, which emits strings for text messages and buffers for binary messages.  #### `driver.on('error', function(event) {})`  Adds a callback to execute when a protocol error occurs due to the other peer sending an invalid byte sequence. `event` will have a `message` attribute describing the error.  #### `driver.on('close', function(event) {})`  Adds a callback to execute when the socket becomes closed. The `event` object has `code` and `reason` attributes.  #### `driver.addExtension(extension)`  Registers a protocol extension whose operation will be negotiated via the `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header. `extension` is any extension compatible with the [websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node) framework.  #### `driver.setHeader(name, value)`  Sets a custom header to be sent as part of the handshake response, either from the server or from the client. Must be called before `start()`, since this is when the headers are serialized and sent.  #### `driver.start()`  Initiates the protocol by sending the handshake - either the response for a server-side driver or the request for a client-side one. This should be the first method you invoke.  Returns `true` if and only if a handshake was sent.  #### `driver.parse(string)`  Takes a string and parses it, potentially resulting in message events being emitted (see `on('message')` above) or in data being sent to `driver.io`.  You should send all data you receive via I/O to this method by piping a stream into `driver.io`.  #### `driver.text(string)`  Sends a text message over the socket. If the socket handshake is not yet complete, the message will be queued until it is. Returns `true` if the message was sent or queued, and `false` if the socket can no longer send messages.  This method is equivalent to `driver.messages.write(string)`.  #### `driver.binary(buffer)`  Takes a `Buffer` and sends it as a binary message. Will queue and return `true` or `false` the same way as the `text` method. It will also return `false` if the driver does not support binary messages.  This method is equivalent to `driver.messages.write(buffer)`.  #### `driver.ping(string = '', function() {})`  Sends a ping frame over the socket, queueing it if necessary. `string` and the callback are both optional. If a callback is given, it will be invoked when the socket receives a pong frame whose content matches `string`. Returns `false` if frames can no longer be sent, or if the driver does not support ping/pong.  #### `driver.pong(string = '')`  Sends a pong frame over the socket, queueing it if necessary. `string` is optional. Returns `false` if frames can no longer be sent, or if the driver does not support ping/pong.  You don't need to call this when a ping frame is received; pings are replied to automatically by the driver. This method is for sending unsolicited pongs.  #### `driver.close()`  Initiates the closing handshake if the socket is still open. For drivers with no closing handshake, this will result in the immediate execution of the `on('close')` driver. For drivers with a closing handshake, this sends a closing frame and `emit('close')` will execute when a response is received or a protocol error occurs.  #### `driver.version`  Returns the WebSocket version in use as a string. Will either be `hixie-75`, `hixie-76` or `hybi-$version`.  #### `driver.protocol`  Returns a string containing the selected subprotocol, if any was agreed upon using the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` mechanism. This value becomes available after `emit('open')` has fired.   ## License  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2010-2016 James Coglan  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

'Derivative Works' shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.        'Contribution' shall mean any work of authorship, including       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of       the copyright owner.

'Contributor' shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and       subsequently incorporated within the Work.     2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.     3.

Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
